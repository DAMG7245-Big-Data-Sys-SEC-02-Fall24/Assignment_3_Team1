       "    'md': \"# INTRODUCTION\\n\\nPrivate equity (PE) involves the acquisition of stock market listed or private companies, typically through funds managed by specialized firms, with the aim of increasing the companies' value over a number of years before eventually selling them to realize returns for investors.¹\\n\\nPE rose to prominence in the 1980s, when high-profile leveraged buyouts, financed by the high-yield junk bonds pioneered by Michael Milken at investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert, targeted multi-billion-dollar companies, such as RJR Nabisco, Federated Department Stores, and Beatrice Companies. Today, PE has grown into a sizable asset class, with $3.3 trillion in worldwide assets under management as of 2022.² Most foundations and university endowments (88%, according to a 2017 survey of 41 firms³) are invested in private equity, as are many other institutional investors. Yale University, long a pioneer of alternative asset class investment, currently allocates 17.5% of its endowment to private equity,⁴ and the Virginia Retirement System allocates even more (33%).⁵\\n\\nPrivate equity is an intermediate asset class: Asset owners, such as endowments or pension plans, invest capital in private equity funds that in turn buy companies, own them for a number of years, then sell them and distribute the proceeds to their investors. How well asset owners fare when they entrust their capital to private equity fund managers depends on the managers' ability to select suitable companies for investment; their ability to help their portfolio companies grow, become more efficient, and innovate; and their ability to estimate attractive valuations. How well asset owners fare also depends on how well aligned fund managers' interests are with those of their investors.\\n\\nIn this review, I will critically synthesize the main insights of more than 80 academic studies of private equity, with a special focus on the performance of private equity as an asset class and its track record of value creation. I will also focus on the key aspects of investing in private equity that are relevant to investors in private equity funds. \\n\\n----\\n\\n¹ My focus in this review is on PE funds that acquire mature companies rather than on private debt funds that lend to companies or on venture capital funds that invest in entrepreneurial start-ups. For a review of the academic literature on private debt funds, see Block, Jang, Kaplan, and Schulze (2023). For a review of the academic literature on venture capital, see Da Rin, Hellmann, and Puri (2013).\\n\\n² See Exhibit 4 in www.mckinsey.com/-/media/mckinsey/industries/private%20equity%20and%20principal%20investors/our%20insights/mckinseys%20private%20markets%20annual%20review/2023/mckinsey-global-privatemarkets-review-2023.pdf.\\n\\n³ See www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/2bsvxkjemopafwrmf84jk/portfolio/survey-endowments-and-foundations-unfazed-by-private-equity-valuations.\\n\\n⁴ See https://news.yale.edu/2020/09/24/investment-return-68-brings-yale-endowment-value-312-billion.\\n\\n⁵ See Financial Times, “US Pension Funds Worth $1.5tn Add Risk through Leverage” (20 January 2024). www.ft.com/content/623b67f9-090c-45f7-a327-dc9f767e327a. \\n\\n© 2024 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

Many of the 1980s buyouts were hostile in the sense that the acquisition proceeded against target management’s will.\\n\\nAs interest rates increased in the late 1980s and the economy headed into a recession, many of the highest-profile leveraged buyouts ran into trouble. By 1990, an era came to an end when Drexel Burnham Lambert agreed not to contest six federal felony charges, paid a record fine of $650 million, and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\\n\\nDuring the 1990s, private equity recovered and institutionalized. Deal sizes increased while value-creation strategies became less hostile and more focused on bringing about operational efficiencies. Fund sizes increased commensurately, and mega-funds became more common.\\n\\nThe bursting of the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) bubble in the early 2000s left in its wake many high-profile casualties—notably two leading private equity firms, Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst and Forstmann, Little & Company. Between 2000 and 2003, deal sizes and leverage ratios fell again, and some early investors in private equity (such as Chase Capital Partners) sold off their investments in PE funds.\\n\\nBetween 2003 and 2007, the PE market first recovered (as interest rates fell) and then boomed. Deal sizes grew to the point where “club deals,” the practice of syndicating the acquisition of a large target among a group of PE funds, became common.

The GP makes investment decisions, oversees portfolio companies, and executes the fund’s value-creation strategy. LPs are typically institutional investors—such as pension funds, college endowments, foundations, insurance companies, family offices, and sovereign wealth funds—or high-net-worth individuals. The relationship between the GP and the fund’s LPs is governed by the fund’s limited partnership agreement (LPA). Among other conditions, the LPA sets out the:\\n\\n- fund’s purpose and strategy;\\n- types of investments the fund intends to undertake, along with any restrictions or exclusions imposed on its investment strategy;\\n- fund’s term, which is usually limited to 10 years but often can be extended for a year or two before the fund must be liquidated;\\n- LPs’ obligations, including, importantly, how much capital they have committed to contribute to the fund;\\n- length of the commitment period—that is, the period during which the GP can require LPs to contribute capital by issuing “capital calls” that “draw down” capital against LPs’ committed capital;\\n- level of the annual management fee the GP is to be paid (often, 1%-2% of committed capital) as well as the share of the fund’s profits to which the GP is entitled (called the carried interest or carry, often 20%), along with any performance hurdles imposed on the GP (say, an 8% hurdle before the GP is eligible to receive carried interest);\\n- distribution waterfall—that is, the order in which the fund’s profits are distributed to LPs and the GP;\\n- conditions governing the sale and transfer of LP interests in the fund; and\\n- protective covenants that restrict the GP’s discretion when managing the fund on behalf of the LPs.\\n\\nA typical commitment period lasts three to five years, during which the fund scouts for suitable deals and begins to implement a variety of value-creation strategies for the portfolio companies it acquires. Once the commitment period ends, the fund’s active acquisition phase also ends: It will not add further companies to its portfolio, although it may continue to make add-on acquisitions out of any remaining committed capital reserved for this purpose. A consequence of this arrangement is that PE firms need to raise new funds every three to five years if they wish to stay in business.

       "    'md': \"# The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\\n\\nCompared with public corporations, limited partnerships are high in governance mechanisms. Besides enforcing their rights under the LPA by legal means, if necessary, what limited governance LPs can engage in involves the Limited Partner Advisory Committee (LPAC), a body typically tasked with resolving conflicts of interest or waiving restrictive covenants in accordance with the LPA's provisions. LPs will not actively intervene in a fund's management.\\n\\nLerner and Schoar (2004), studying the US setting, argue that the reason for this approach is likely legal. Although the GP has unlimited liability for any debts, LPs are liable only up to the amount they have contributed to the fund. Under the Uniform Limited Partnership Act, however, LPs risk losing their limited-liability status if they exercise so much control over the fund's day-to-day running that they ought to be deemed as general partners. Largely for this reason, LPs in practice act as passive sources of capital. They are not actively engaged in prospecting for deals, adding value to portfolio companies, or making exit decisions.\\n\\nAn important feature of PE funds is that LPs do not pay in their committed capital up front. Instead, LPs receive a capital call whenever the GP wishes to draw down capital in order to make an investment during the commitment period. In other words, when becoming an investor in a fund, each LP commits to making capital available at unknown times during the next three to five years. LPs are thus effectively short a sequence of long-dated options with unknown maturities and individually uncertain strike prices, which the GP can exercise at its discretion at a time of its choosing. From the GP's perspective, a desirable consequence of this “capital-on-demand” arrangement is that the fund’s “IRR clock” ticks only when LPs’ capital is invested in deals rather than sitting in a transaction account that earns little interest. Moreover, all else equal, the shorter the time LPs’ capital is invested for, the higher the internal rate of return (IRR).\\n\\nIt is LPs who bear the cost of ensuring they have sufficient liquidity available to meet capital calls. Managing such liquidity exposure over multiple years can be challenging, and the less predictable a fund’s capital calls, the greater the challenge. Ensuring liquidity is available when required has an obvious opportunity cost: the LP earns less on liquid investments than it could by investing in other assets. LPs ought to take into account this opportunity cost when computing, and reporting, the returns they earn on their allocation to PE. In practice, however, they rarely do so, suggesting that publicly available performance metrics overstate the true economic returns LPs earn when investing in PE funds.\",\n",

This seemingly straightforward question proves difficult to answer, for four principal reasons.\\n\\n- **Private equity is an opaque asset class:** Although a PE fund has a duty to report its performance to its LPs (and, in the United States since 2012, to the SEC), it has no obligation to disclose its performance to the public. LPAs often explicitly bar LPs from sharing performance data they receive from a PE fund (and the SEC does not make individual fund disclosures public). Data availability thus constrains performance measurement.\\n  \\n- **Private equity largely invests in private assets:** Not being traded in financial markets, private assets cannot be marked to market easily, and estimating their value before exit is difficult.\\n\\n- **Private equity invests in illiquid assets:** Illiquidity exposes a PE fund to the risk that there may be insufficient demand at an acceptable valuation when a portfolio company is ready to be exited.\\n\\n- **Private equity has long investment horizons:** As the J-curve illustrates, PE funds are usually cash flow negative for many years before they begin returning capital, and they typically generate capital gains only toward the end of their lives.\\n\\n## Industry Practices\\n\\nThe PE industry usually reports three key performance indicators (KPIs) to LPs: IRR, TVPI, and DPI.\\n\\n- **IRR** stands for internal rate of return and is well known from standard MBA textbooks. It measures the fund’s annualized rate of return, considering the timing and magnitude of the fund’s cash flows (i.e., its drawdowns and net-of-fees distributions). As such, an IRR can be computed only once a fund has been wound down at the end of its life, yet it is standard industry practice to report IRRs throughout a fund’s life. To this end, a fund treats the estimated value of its unrealized portfolio holdings as a future terminal cash flow.\\n\\n- Because portfolio holdings are private and illiquid, estimating their value accurately can be challenging.

Their conclusion is that PE funds generate negative abnormal returns after fees on a risk-adjusted basis. Boyer et al. (2023) take yet another approach: They infer returns from the negotiated prices at which LP interests in PE funds change hands in secondary transactions, concluding that PE funds do not outperform on a risk-adjusted basis.\\n\\nThese and similar studies are difficult to compare because each uses a different dataset and adjusts for risk in a different way, making many different assumptions along the way. Consensus on whether PE funds generate positive risk-adjusted alpha after fees thus remains elusive.\\n\\nThe fact that PE deals are more highly leveraged than the companies in the S&P 500 has long troubled scholars of PE performance, notwithstanding Sørensen and Jagannathan’s (2015) analytical finding that PME is invariant to leverage. L’Hér, Stoyanova, Shaw, Scott, and Lai (2016) find zero alpha when using a levered size- and sector-adjusted index to adjust for risk and leverage. In a thought-provoking study, Stafford (2022) shows that PE funds underperform a leveraged strategy of investing in small value firms that are listed on the stock market. Ang, Chen, Goetzmann, and Philippou (2018), using a Bayesian approach, reach a different conclusion: In their model, PE returns cannot be replicated using listed stocks.\\n\\nBesides risk and leverage, positive abnormal returns after fees could compensate LPs for liquidity risk. Financial economists have studied three types of liquidity risk in this context. The first results from the exposure of the returns on a PE fund’s portfolio companies to unexpected fluctuations in marketwide liquidity, a factor that Pástor and Stambaugh (2003) show is a priced risk factor in public equity markets. Franzoni, Nowak, and Philippou (2012) estimate a four-factor model that includes a Pástor-Stambaugh liquidity factor alongside the three Fama-French factors. Finding an insignificant alpha, they conclude that PE funds generate returns after fees that compensate LPs for this type of liquidity—but no more than that. Ang et al. (2018) also find that PE returns load on a proxy for market illiquidity, but only partly: Some positive alpha remains after accounting for exposure to marketwide liquidity risk.\\n\\nThe second type of liquidity risk arises because absent a liquid secondary market, LPs cannot easily exit a fund over its 10-year life should their portfolio needs change. Sørensen, Wang, and Yang (2014) incorporate this type of liquidity risk into a dynamic portfolio choice model. Their conclusion is that PE funds’ observed abnormal returns after fees are just large enough to compensate LPs for being locked into a 10-year commitment that is difficult to hedge.\\n\\nThe third type of liquidity risk relates to the J-curve. Having committed capital to a fund, LPs run the risk of receiving capital calls when liquidity is expensive. Robinson and Sensoy (2016) argue that this type of liquidity risk is unlikely to be material on average because drawdowns.'}],\n",

Kaplan and Schoar (2005) were the first to study persistence, finding that in the 1980s and 1990s, PE firms that outperformed their peers in one fund were likely to continue outperforming their peers in subsequent funds. \\n\\nPersistence is seen as indicative of GP skill. Using different data and empirical approaches, Robinson and Sensoy (2016), Korteweg and Sorensen (2017), and Gupta and van Nieuwerburgh (2021) likewise find evidence of persistence, although Harris, Jenkinson, Kaplan, and Stucke (2023) and Braun, Jenkinson, and Stoff (2017) show that persistence has weakened over time at the fund and the deal level, respectively. The return spread can be large: Korteweg and Sorensen (2017) estimate that top-quartile funds persistently outperform bottom-quartile funds by 7–8 percentage points a year. Return persistence in private equity contrasts sharply with that of mutual funds, for which past performance is viewed as a poor predictor of future performance.\\n\\nWhether LPs can exploit persistence in practice is open to question: Many studies estimate persistence from the realized returns funds will earn over their approximately 10-year lifetimes, yet PE firms raise new funds every 3–5 years, well before the final returns on their current funds are realized and publicly known. When deciding to invest in a new fund, LPs therefore have to make do with publicly available data on the current fund’s interim KPIs (such as net-of-fee IRR to date, TVPI, and DPI). Interim performance is a much noisier predictor of the next fund’s performance than the current fund’s lifetime return once realized in the future. Based on this insight, Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Vissing-Jørgensen (2014) propose a model in which LPs that invest in a PE firm’s current fund have an information advantage over other potential investors in the next fund, in the form of access to “soft” information about the GP’s ability to persistently generate high returns. This information advantage gives current LPs bargaining power vis-à-vis the GP. The model can explain the empirical regularity that PE firms tend not to raise their fees in line with their performance and instead “price” their funds to have excess demand from LPs. Investors in earlier funds then earn abnormal returns in later funds as they can “hold up” the GP by threatening not to invest in the next fund, which other market participants with access only to public information would interpret as a negative signal in the familiar adverse-selection sense. \\n\\n> **Note:** Part of the observed return persistence is mechanical because consecutive funds are raised only a few years apart and are subject to similar macroeconomic conditions.

       "    'md': '# Academic Views of PE Value Creation\\n\\nTo a financial economist, absolute measures of value creation and accounting-based approaches such as the value bridge are meaningless. Only that part of the valuation increase that would not have happened but for a PE fund’s investment in a portfolio company can be attributed to the PE fund as its value creation. Measuring the extent to which private equity creates economic value thus requires a benchmark, or counterfactual, for what would have happened absent the PE fund’s investment. In other words, measuring value creation is inherently a relative exercise.\\n\\nThe “but for” qualifier is key: If PE funds simply invest in portfolio companies whose operations and performance were about to improve regardless of PE ownership, they are simply stock pickers and cannot be credited with creating economic value. In academic parlance, stock picking leads to a selection effect (returns to LPs are high because PE funds pick future winners), while value creation manifests as a treatment effect (returns to LPs are high because PE funds causally increase the value of their portfolio companies during the ownership period).\\n\\nBut even if PE funds create economic value at their portfolio companies in this causal-treatment sense, it is possible that they do so at the expense of another party. In other words, creating “private value” for their investors need not imply that PE funds create “social value” for the economy as a whole. The creation of social value can be likened to increasing the size of the economic pie. Activities that do not increase the size of the economic pie may create private value for investors, but they do not create social value for the wider economy. Instead, such activities create value for one party at the expense of another.\\n\\nAn example of an activity that arguably does not increase the size of the pie is stock picking. Suppose a GP is simply good at spotting undervalued companies and effects no productive changes at its portfolio companies during the ownership period.

       "    'md': '# The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\\n\\nRobinson and Sensoy (2013) investigate LPs’ recurrent concern that GPs earn excessive management fees but find no evidence that high-fee funds underperform low-fee funds after fees. The same appears to be true for the carried interest, which also does not predict after-fee returns. The finer details of GPs’ compensation formulas, however, appear to distort GP incentives. Robinson and Sensoy (2013) also find that PE funds time their portfolio exits in a self-serving manner.

Typically, transactions are priced at a discount to the fund’s reported NAV. Analyzing transaction data received from an unnamed intermediary, Nadulad, Sensoy, Vorkink, and Weisbach (2019) report an average discount of 13.8%, although this average includes plenty of fire sales completed during the Global Financial Crisis—a more typical discount in their data is 9%. Nadulad et al. (2019) further report that buyers outperform sellers by 5 percentage points a year over the average fund’s life, gross of transaction costs, suggesting two conclusions: First, the discounts to NAV truly are discounts; and second, selling LPs do not sell based on private information about a fund’s performance having peaked, at least not on average.\\n\\n## Exits\\n\\nTraditionally, PE funds exited their portfolio companies either by selling them to strategic buyers (i.e., operating companies) or by listing them on a stock exchange. Beginning in the mid-2000s, a third type of exit emerged: sponsor-to-sponsor deals (also called secondary buyouts), in which a PE firm’s PE fund sells its portfolio company to another PE firm’s PE fund. Secondary buyouts now account for more than half of PE exits. More recently, a fourth type of exit has become popular: GP-led secondaries, in which a PE firm’s PE fund sells its portfolio company to another fund controlled by the same PE firm (essentially, the PE firm sells the portfolio company to itself). The acquiring fund is typically a newly formed “continuation vehicle” that will often own no other assets (i.e., it is a single-asset fund). The LPs in the selling fund are usually invited to invest in the continuation vehicle, although they may be required to simultaneously commit capital to the GP’s next fund (a so-called “stapled” transaction). Between 2017 and 2021, GP-led secondaries grew at a compound annual growth rate of 48%.\\n\\nBoth secondary buyouts and GP-led secondaries raise issues of interest to LPs. The academic literature to date has focused on secondary buyouts. LPs may be concerned about secondary buyouts for three reasons. First, if there are diminishing returns to PE value creation, a secondary buyer may struggle to add much value to a portfolio company, resulting in lower returns. Second, buying funds may buy because they have capital left to burn toward the end of their life, rather than because the deal is likely to be good for their LPs. This concern arises because of the one-way-bet nature of GP compensation: It may be tempting (from the viewpoint of a GP that does not value its reputation too highly) to draw down the last few dollars of capital. If the deal pays off, the GP will earn carry; if the deal goes south, the GP will have lost “OPM” (other people’s money). Third, a well-diversified LP may have a stake in both the selling fund and the buying fund.\\n\\nCFA Institute Research Foundation 25',\n",

       "      'md': 'Traditionally, PE funds exited their portfolio companies either by selling them to strategic buyers (i.e., operating companies) or by listing them on a stock exchange. Beginning in the mid-2000s, a third type of exit emerged: sponsor-to-sponsor deals (also called secondary buyouts), in which a PE firm’s PE fund sells its portfolio company to another PE firm’s PE fund. Secondary buyouts now account for more than half of PE exits. More recently, a fourth type of exit has become popular: GP-led secondaries, in which a PE firm’s PE fund sells its portfolio company to another fund controlled by the same PE firm (essentially, the PE firm sells the portfolio company to itself). The acquiring fund is typically a newly formed “continuation vehicle” that will often own no other assets (i.e., it is a single-asset fund). The LPs in the selling fund are usually invited to invest in the continuation vehicle, although they may be required to simultaneously commit capital to the GP’s next fund (a so-called “stapled” transaction). Between 2017 and 2021, GP-led secondaries grew at a compound annual growth rate of 48%.\\n\\nBoth secondary buyouts and GP-led secondaries raise issues of interest to LPs. The academic literature to date has focused on secondary buyouts. LPs may be concerned about secondary buyouts for three reasons. First, if there are diminishing returns to PE value creation, a secondary buyer may struggle to add much value to a portfolio company, resulting in lower returns. Second, buying funds may buy because they have capital left to burn toward the end of their life, rather than because the deal is likely to be good for their LPs. This concern arises because of the one-way-bet nature of GP compensation: It may be tempting (from the viewpoint of a GP that does not value its reputation too highly) to draw down the last few dollars of capital. If the deal pays off, the GP will earn carry; if the deal goes south, the GP will have lost “OPM” (other people’s money). Third, a well-diversified LP may have a stake in both the selling fund and the buying fund.\\n\\nCFA Institute Research Foundation 25'}],\n",

They examine whether PE firms’ voluntary ESG disclosures are driven by investor (limited partners, LPs) demand for sustainable investments and if these disclosures align with the actual ESG performance of portfolio companies. Using a novel dataset from PE firms’ websites, the research finds an increasing trend in ESG disclosures over time, suggesting that LPs’ sustainability preferences impact PE firms’ disclosure practices. Additionally, firms with more ESG disclosures are associated with better ESG outcomes in their investments, alleviating concerns about greenwashing.\\n\\n## Acharya, V. V., O. F. Gottschalg, M.

Analyzing 395 deals by 37 PE houses in Western Europe from 1991 to 2007, the study finds that a significant portion of deal IRRs stems from abnormal performance, indicating enterprise-level value creation beyond that of sector peers. This performance is associated with operational improvements in portfolio companies and the experience and background of deal partners, suggesting that top PE houses create economic value through skilled operational enhancements and strategic M&A activities.\\n\\n## Albertus, J., and M. Denes. 2024. \\n“Private Equity Fund Debt: Agency Costs and Cash Flow Management.” Working paper, Carnegie Mellon University.\\n\\nThe authors investigate the use of subscription lines of credit (SLCs) in private equity (PE), a growing trend in which PE funds use debt financing at the fund level. Through novel data, the study explores how SLCs affect capital deployment from limited partners (LPs), fund performance, and whether their uses align with cash flow management or stem from agency conflicts. The findings suggest that SLCs enable funds to call capital less frequently, potentially distorting performance measures such as internal rate of return (IRR). The use of SLCs is not solely motivated by cash flow management objectives, however, with indications of agency conflicts playing a role.\\n\\n## Aldatmaz, S., and G. W.

The study identifies three main mechanisms driving these changes: creation of new power plants, transactions of existing plants, and decommissioning of outdated facilities.

The PE advantage is especially strong in monitoring and operational practices associated with modern management technologies. Additionally, PE-owned firms show greater delegation of authority to plant managers in areas such as sales, marketing, and new product introductions.

This decline suggests a new dimension in which buyouts may positively affect workers. The study also explores how improvements in workplace safety post-buyout benefit firms and PE owners, indicating a potential source of value creation. Overall, the findings challenge the conventional narrative of buyouts negatively impacting workers.\\n\\nDa Rin, M., T. Hellmann, and M.

It outlines the growth of the VC industry over the past 30 years and explains the typical structure of VC markets, highlighting the roles of limited partners (LPs) and general partners (GPs). The survey identifies three main research strands in the VC literature: the interaction between entrepreneurial companies and VC, the interaction between VC funds and their investors, and the organization of VC firms.\\n\\nDavis, S.

Addressing conflicting views, it critiques industry-sponsored studies for their limitations and lack of establishment-level data. The study overcomes these constraints by using the Longitudinal Business Database to analyze employment changes before and after buyouts at both firm and establishment levels. Findings suggest that while employment shrinks more rapidly at target establishments post-buyout, target firms engage in more greenfield job creation and exhibit a higher pace of job reallocation. Moreover, buyouts improve productivity mainly through the directed reallocation of resources across units within target firms, leading to material improvements in operating margins.\\n\\nDavis, S.

Analyzing approximately 9,800 PE buyouts in the United States from 1980 to 2013, the study reveals significant heterogeneity in outcomes based on factors such as credit conditions, type of buyout, and sponsoring PE groups. Findings indicate substantial productivity gains, differing employment trends between privately held and publicly listed firms, and the influence of credit spreads and GDP growth on employment dynamics. The research also highlights variations in buyout effects among PE groups, with implications for post-buyout employment performance. Overall, the study underscores the nuanced and circumstance-specific nature of buyout impacts, contributing to financial theory and empirical evidence.',\n",

Empirical tests confirm a correlation between realized risk and investor returns, supporting the theory's predictions.\\n\\nFang, L., V. Ivashina, and J. Lerner. 2015. “The Disintermediation of Financial Markets: Direct Investing in Private Equity.” Journal of Financial Economics 116 (1):160–78. doi:10.1016/ j.jfineco.2014.12.002\\n\\nThe article examines the performance of direct private equity investments made by institutional investors, comparing co-investments alongside private equity funds and solo direct investments over a 20-year period. Direct investments outperform public market benchmarks, but performance relative to private equity fund benchmarks is mixed. Co-investments tend to underperform, which appears to be driven by selection as co-investments are concentrated in larger deals during market peaks. Solo direct investments outperform fund benchmarks, with the outperformance greater for local deals and in later-stage transactions where information problems are less severe. The results suggest it is difficult for institutional investors to capture the rents earned by private equity fund managers through direct investing, especially in settings with higher information asymmetries.\\n\\nFracassi, C., A.

It examines changes in product prices, sales, product mix, and geographic availability following PE acquisitions. Findings reveal that PE targets experience a 50% increase in retail sales post-deal, driven by new product sales.\"}],\n",

The authors propose a novel two-step methodology that accounts for the cash flow risk inherent in PE investments by estimating exposure to a broader set of risk factors and incorporating strip prices. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of the risks involved and provides more accurate valuations, revealing that traditional methods may overstate performance.\\n\\nGupta, Atul, Sabrina T.

Using a national sample spanning nearly two decades, it uses patient-level data to analyze mortality rates and patient well-being. Although some patients may not experience significant changes, average mortality increases post-PE ownership. The study also examines financial strategies post-acquisition, revealing increased billing to Medicare and changes in expenditure patterns. Policy implications suggest potential improvements in patient outcomes through better alignment of incentives between PE firms, facility owners, and patients.\\n\\nHarford, J., and A.

Evidence from a Comprehensive Sample of Large Buyouts.”  \\n**Management Science** 60 (4):888–902. doi:10.1287/mnsc.2013.1790  \\nThe study investigates the contentious issue of whether private equity sponsors generate returns by creating value or by wealth transfers. Although prior literature suggests potential wealth transfer to strategic buyers and debtholders, empirical evidence indicates otherwise. The study finds that stock prices of strategic buyers increase upon acquiring portfolio companies from sponsors, and debt covenants or sponsor reputation concerns prevent excessive payouts that harm debt investors. Although some evidence of wealth transfer exists in certain scenarios, the majority of cases show no harm to financial claimants.\\n\\nHarris, R. S., T. Jenkinson, and S. N.

Analyzing both buyout and venture capital (VC) funds separately, the study reassesses PE fund performance in absolute terms and relative to public markets. Results indicate markedly positive performance for buyout funds, with returns exceeding those of public markets for most vintages since 1984. Using various benchmarks, buyout fund outperformance remains consistent. VC fund returns, however, show variability across decades. The paper also examines the relationship between fund performance and capital commitments, finding a negative correlation. Overall, the findings suggest that buyout funds have consistently outperformed public markets, offering investors a premium despite the illiquidity of PE investments.',\n",

These findings underscore the importance of LBO firms as financial intermediaries in facilitating LBO transactions and accessing favorable credit markets.\\n\\nJegadeesh, N., R. Kräussl, and J.

They develop a new approach to directly estimate ex ante expected returns from observed market prices. By analyzing publicly traded funds of funds (FoFs) and listed private equity funds (LPEs), the study finds that the market expects relatively low abnormal returns for both types of investments, with FoFs ranging from -0.25% to 2.0% and LPEs ranging from -0.5% to 0.25%. The research emphasizes the importance of using market prices to estimate the risk and return profile of private equity.\\n\\nJenkinson, T., S. Morkoetter, T. Schori, and T.

Do Private Equity Fund Managers Have Market Timing Abilities?” *Journal of Banking & Finance* 138 (May):1–14. doi:10.1016/j.jbankfin.2022.106424.\\n\\nThe authors investigate whether private equity (PE) fund managers have the ability to time the markets when buying and selling portfolio companies. Using a sample of PE deals benchmarked against M&A transaction multiples, the study finds evidence that PE fund managers create value by timing the financial markets. They sell portfolio companies when market multiples are higher than at the time of investment. The authors also find that market-timing ability is more pronounced at the time of exiting investments compared with entering investments, likely because fund managers have more flexibility in choosing exit timing.'}],\n",

Nagel. 2016. “Risk-Adjusting the Returns to Venture Capital.” \\n**Journal of Finance** 71 (3):1437–70. doi:10.1111/jofi.12390  \\nThe authors develop a methodology to risk-adjust the returns of venture capital investments by modeling the security-level exposure of VC funds to market and idiosyncratic risks over the life of their investments. The authors find that VC fund returns remain high even after correcting for the excessive smoothing of returns and adjusting for risk exposures. Although some of this return compensates for the risk and costs of VC investing, the results suggest a large non-marketable component likely reflecting the optionality and illiquidity of the asset class. The returns are highest for firms raising follow-on funds quickly after good performance.\\n\\n## Korteweg, A., and M.

The authors propose a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimator that explicitly models the unobserved valuation path between observed valuations and corrects for the selection bias. Applying this estimator to venture capital data, they find that accounting for selection leads to substantially lower alpha estimates and higher estimates of systematic and idiosyncratic risk compared with traditional approaches.\\n\\n## Korteweg, A., and M.

The authors develop a new methodology that separates fund performance into a skill component that persists across funds raised by the same manager and a luck/deal component that is uncorrelated across funds. They find that both skill and luck play highly significant roles. There is a skill premium, however, that is substantial in economic terms and has persisted over time.

PE-owned hospitals charge significantly higher prices compared with non-PE-owned hospitals. These price increases are primarily driven by PE-owned hospitals’ increased bargaining power and willingness to engage in tougher negotiations with insurers. The higher prices lead to a net reduction in patient welfare, because the price increases outweigh any potential quality improvements associated with PE ownership.\\n\\n## Ljungqvist, A., and M. Richardson. 2003. “The Cash Flow, Return, and Risk Characteristics of Private Equity.”\\n- NBER Working Paper 9454. doi:10.3386/w9454\\n- The authors analyze the cash flow, return, and risk characteristics of private equity (PE) funds. Theirs is the first study that had access to detailed cash flow data for each fund, rather than aggregate or self-reported returns. These data allow the authors to map out the J-curve using real data. The authors show that it takes several years for capital to be invested and more than 10 years for capital to be returned to generate excess returns. They then relate the rates of drawdowns and distributions to changes in investment opportunities and competition among PE funds. The authors estimate that PE funds in their sample generated annual excess returns of 5% to 8% relative to the public equity market, earning a risk-adjusted public market equivalent (PME) of 1.24. The authors conjecture that this level of excess returns represents compensation for holding an illiquid investment.\\n\\n## Ljungqvist, A., M. Richardson, and D. Wolfenzon. 2020. “The Investment Behavior of Buyout Funds: Theory and Evidence.”\\n- Financial Management 49 (1):3–32. doi:10.1111/fima.12264\\n- The authors theoretically model and empirically test the determinants of private equity (PE) funds’ investment decisions, which they link to changes in the demand for PE, conditions in the credit market, and PE fund managers’ ability to influence perceptions of their talent. In their empirical tests, the authors use a dataset of 207 US PE funds that invested in 1,957 portfolio companies over a 30-year period. For established funds, but not for first-time funds, the authors find that funds accelerate their investment rate and generate higher returns for investors when investment opportunities improve, competition for deal flow eases, and credit market conditions loosen. Less established funds invest in riskier portfolio companies in an effort to create a track record. PE funds become more conservative in their investment behavior following periods of good performance.\\n\\n## Long, A., and C.

Theirs is the first study that had access to detailed cash flow data for each fund, rather than aggregate or self-reported returns. These data allow the authors to map out the J-curve using real data. The authors show that it takes several years for capital to be invested and more than 10 years for capital to be returned to generate excess returns. They then relate the rates of drawdowns and distributions to changes in investment opportunities and competition among PE funds. The authors estimate that PE funds in their sample generated annual excess returns of 5% to 8% relative to the public equity market, earning a risk-adjusted public market equivalent (PME) of 1.24.

The article suggests that by using value investing strategies, homemade leverage, and hold-to-maturity accounting practices, investors can mimic the return profile of PE investments. The author provides theoretical insights and empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of this replication strategy, offering investors an alternative approach to accessing the benefits typically associated with private equity investments.\\n\\n## Stucke, R. 2011. \\n### “Updating History.” \\n**Working paper**, University of Oxford. doi:10.2139/ ssrn.197636  \\nThe author analyzes the Thomson VentureXpert (TVE) database, which has been widely used to benchmark the performance of private equity and venture capital funds. The study finds severe anomalies in the underlying data, resulting from funds that stopped being updated during their active lifetime. About 40% of funds have missing cash flows, mainly on the distribution side, and carried-forward net asset values, leading to a significant downward bias in private equity performance.

       "1. **Consistent Returns on and of Capital:** The company has a strong track record of delivering returns on capital employed (ROCE) and has set a goal to maintain peer-leading ROCE performance. The five-year average ROCE for ConocoPhillips is 14%, which is higher than many of its peers.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Cash Flow Growth:** ConocoPhillips projects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~6% for cash from operations (CFO) and ~11% for free cash flow (FCF) from 2024 to 2032 at a $60/BBL WTI price. This indicates a robust growth trajectory for cash flow.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Strong Balance Sheet:** The company aims to reduce its debt by $5 billion by 2026, which will result in an annual interest reduction of approximately $250 million. The net debt to CFO ratio is projected to be 0.3x on average from 2024 to 2028, indicating a strong balance sheet.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Distribution Commitment:** ConocoPhillips has committed to returning 30% of CFO to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, which demonstrates a focus on shareholder returns."

       "\n",
       "1. **Commodity Price Volatility:** The financial projections are based on certain price assumptions for oil and gas. Any significant deviation from these price assumptions could impact the company's cash flow and profitability. For example, a prolonged decline in oil prices could reduce cash from operations and free cash flow.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Regulatory and Environmental Risks:** Changes in environmental regulations or the imposition of new carbon taxes could increase operating costs and impact profitability. The company's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 also involves significant investments and operational changes.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Operational Risks:** Potential failures or delays in achieving expected production levels from existing and future developments could impact financial performance. This includes risks related to drilling, technical difficulties, and unexpected cost increases.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Geopolitical Risks:** Global and regional changes, such as military conflicts, trade restrictions, and political instability, could affect the demand, supply, and prices of oil and gas. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine is an example of a geopolitical risk that could impact the company's operations and financial performance."

Today, PE has grown into a sizable asset class, with $3.3 trillion \\nin worldwide assets under management as of 2022.2 Most foundations and university endow -\\nments (88%, according to a 2017 survey of 41 firms3) are invested in private equity, as are many \\nother institutional investors. Yale University, long a pioneer of alternative asset class invest -\\nment, currently allocates 17.5% of its endowment to private equity,4 and the Virginia Retirement \\nSystem allocates even more (33%).5\\nPrivate equity is an intermediated asset class: Asset owners, such as endowments or pension \\nplans, invest capital in private equity funds that in turn buy companies, own them for a number \\nof years, then sell them and distribute the proceeds to their investors. How well asset owners \\nfare when they entrust their capital to private equity fund managers depends on the managers’ \\nability to select suitable companies for investment; their ability to help their portfolio compa -\\nnies grow, become more efficient, and innovate; and their ability to exit the companies at attrac -\\ntive valuations. How well asset owners fare also depends on how well aligned fund managers’ \\ninterests are with those of their investors.\\nIn this review, I will critically synthesize the main insights of more than 80 academic studies of \\nprivate equity, with a special focus on the performance of private equity as an asset class and its \\ntrack record of value creation. I will also focus on the key aspects of investing in private equity \\nthat are relevant to investors in private equity funds.\\n© 2024 CFA Institute Research Foundation.

The PE industry as we know it today traces its roots to the \\nmid-20th century. Some say that the first leveraged buyout took place in 1955, when McLean \\nIndustries, Inc. acquired two steamship companies. In the 1960s, Warren Buffett’ s Berkshire \\nHathaway and Victor Posner’ s DWG Corporation popularized the practice of acquiring portfolios \\nof companies much in the same way as PE firms do today.\\nThe growth of the junk bond market in the 1970s and 1980s made possible highly lever -\\naged buyouts of even very large targets such as RJR Nabisco, acquired by KKR in 1989 for a \\nrecord-breaking $31.1 billion. Many of the 1980s buyouts were hostile in the sense that the \\nacquisition proceeded against target management’ s will.\\nAs interest rates increased in the late 1980s and the economy headed into a recession, many \\nof the highest-profile leveraged buyouts ran into trouble. By 1990, an era came to an end when \\nDrexel Burnham Lambert agreed not to contest six federal felony charges, paid a record fine of \\n$650 million, and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\\nDuring the 1990s, private equity recovered and institutionalized. Deal sizes increased while \\nvalue-creation strategies became less hostile and more focused on bringing about operational \\nefficiencies. Fund sizes increased commensurately, and mega-funds became more common.\\nThe bursting of the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) bubble in the early \\n2000s left in its wake many high-profile casualties—notably two leading private equity firms, \\nHicks, Muse, Tate & Furst and Forstmann, Little & Company. Between 2000 and 2003, deal sizes \\nand leverage ratios fell again, and some early investors in private equity (such as Chase Capital \\nPartners) sold off their investments in PE funds.\\nBetween 2003 and 2007, the PE market first recovered (as interest rates fell) and then boomed. \\nDeal sizes grew to the point where “club deals, ” the practice of syndicating the acquisition of a \\nlarge target among a group of PE funds, became common. Marking the peak, a consortium led \\nby KKR and TPG acquired Texan utility TXU in October 2007 for $44.37 billion, much of it funded \\nby debt. (TXU filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2014.)\\nThe 2007–2008 Global Financial Crisis, and the accompanying Great Recession of 2008–2009, \\nled to a credit crunch—especially in the high-yield debt markets that PE firms depend on to \\nfinance their deals. It took seven years for PE fundraising to again surpass the level reached \\nin 2007.\\nRecord-low interest rates have marked the near-decade since then, contributing to a boom in \\nfundraising and dealmaking. Then, as central banks around the world began raising interest \\nrates in early 2022 in an attempt to bring down inflation, dealmaking, portfolio company exits, \\nand fundraising all slowed sharply.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='cb28793c-81f8-4c5f-b218-1f102be394be', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '3', 'file_name': '6636d92f-27a6-4e61-acbb-72756f6e3125_The Economics of Private Equity_ A Critical Review.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\\nCFA Institute Research Foundation  3KEY INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES\\n6Although some PE funds are stock market listed, most are not.\\n7In the typical waterfall, LPs receive all proceeds from exits until their contributed capital has been returned in full, plus a \\npreferred return at the agreed hurdle rate. Then, the GP receives all exit proceeds during a “catch-up” period until the GP \\nhas received 20% of the preferred return. Finally, LPs and the GP split any further exit proceeds according to the carried \\ninterest.In the United States and many other countries, PE funds are set up as limited partnerships, \\nconsisting of a legal entity that serves as the fund’ s manager and general partner (GP) and a \\nrange of limited partners (LPs) that commit to provide the bulk of the capital.6 The GP makes \\ninvestment decisions, oversees portfolio companies, and executes the fund’ s value-creation \\nstrategy. LPs are typically institutional investors—such as pension funds, college endowments, \\nfoundations, insurance companies, family offices, and sovereign wealth funds—or high-net-  \\nworth individuals. The relationship between the GP and the fund’ s LPs is governed by the fund’ s \\nlimited partnership agreement (LPA). Among other conditions, the LPA sets out the:\\n• fund’ s purpose and strategy;\\n• types of investments the fund intends to undertake, along with any restrictions or exclu -\\nsions imposed on its investment strategy;\\n• fund’ s term, which is usually limited to 10 years but often can be extended for a year or two \\nbefore the fund must be liquidated;\\n• LPs’ obligations, including, importantly, how much capital they have committed to contrib -\\nute to the fund;\\n• length of the commitment period—that is, the period during which the GP can require LPs \\nto contribute capital by issuing “capital calls” that “draw down” capital against LPs’ commit -\\nted capital;\\n• level of the annual management fee the GP is to be paid (often, 1%–2% of committed cap -\\nital) as well as the share of the fund’ s profits to which the GP is entitled (called the carried \\ninterest or carry, often 20%), along with any performance hurdles imposed on the GP \\n(say, an 8% hurdle before the GP is eligible to receive carried interest);\\n• distribution waterfall—that is, the order in which the fund’ s profits are distributed to LPs and \\nthe GP;7\\n• conditions governing the sale and transfer of LP interests in the fund; and\\n• protective covenants that restrict the GP’ s discretion when managing the fund on behalf of \\nthe LPs.\\nA typical commitment period lasts three to five years, during which the fund scouts for suitable \\ndeals and begins to implement a variety of value-creation strategies for the portfolio compa -\\nnies it acquires. Once the commitment period ends, the fund’ s active acquisition phase also \\nends: It will not add further companies to its portfolio, although it may continue to make add-on \\nacquisitions out of any remaining committed capital reserved for this purpose. A consequence \\nof this arrangement is that PE firms need to raise new funds every three to five years if they \\nwish to stay in business.

LPs will not actively intervene in a fund’ s management.\\nLerner and Schoar (2004), studying the US setting, argue that the reason for this approach is \\nlikely legal. Although the GP has unlimited liability for any debts, LPs are liable only up to the \\namount they have contributed to the fund. Under the Uniform Limited Partnership Act, how -\\never, LPs risk losing their limited-liability status if they exercise so much control over the fund’ s \\nday-to-day running that they ought to be deemed as general partners. Largely for this reason, \\nLPs in practice act as passive sources of capital. They are not actively engaged in prospecting \\nfor deals, adding value to portfolio companies, or making exit decisions.\\nAn important feature of PE funds is that LPs do not pay in their committed capital up front. \\nInstead, LPs receive a capital call whenever the GP wishes to draw down capital in order to make \\nan investment during the commitment period.9 In other words, when becoming an investor in \\na fund, each LP commits to making capital available at unknown times during the next three to \\nfive years. LPs are thus effectively short a sequence of long-dated options with unknown matur -\\nities and individually uncertain strike prices, which the GP can exercise at its discretion at a time \\nof its choosing. From the GP’ s perspective, a desirable consequence of this “capital-on-demand” \\narrangement is that the fund’ s “IRR clock” ticks only when LPs’ capital is invested in deals rather \\nthan sitting in a transaction account that earns little interest. Moreover, all else equal, the \\nshorter the time LPs’ capital is invested for, the higher the internal rate of return (IRR).10\\nIt is LPs who bear the cost of ensuring they have sufficient liquidity available to meet capital \\ncalls.11 Managing such a liquidity exposure over multiple years can be challenging, and the less \\npredictable a fund’ s capital calls, the greater the challenge. Ensuring liquidity is available when \\nrequired has an obvious opportunity cost: The LP earns less on liquid investments than it could \\nby investing in other assets. LPs ought to take into account this opportunity cost when com -\\nputing, and reporting, the returns they earn on their allocation to PE. In practice, however, they \\nrarely do so, suggesting that publicly available performance metrics overstate the true eco -\\nnomic returns LPs earn when investing in PE funds.12\\n8In reality, PE firms often manage a plethora of side vehicles. See Lerner, Mao, Schoar, and Zhang (2022) for an analysis.\\n9The LPA sets out how soon an LP has to transfer the capital contribution (say, with a month’ s notice).\\n10For a comprehensive treatment of IRR’ s shortcomings in the PE context, see https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/\\ninvestor/2020/10/12/times-up-for-the-irr-resetting-the-clock-on-private-equity/ .\\n11Defaulting on a capital call typically has severe adverse consequences under the LPA. A typical penalty is forfeiture of \\nthe LP’ s fund interest, including capital already invested—although for reputational reasons and to maintain long-term \\nrelationships, a GP may work with an LP at risk of default on its contractual obligations to find a workaround, perhaps \\nby finding a buyer who can take over the LP’ s fund interest and its outstanding commitments.\\n12Two further consequences of LPs committing to provide liquidity on demand are that LPs cannot time the market \\n(Brown, Harris, Hu, Jenkinson, Kaplan, and Robinson 2021) and that the timing of achieving a desired PE allocation \\nis uncertain.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='f7079df9-108c-4437-9d25-abfbbf0d59e4', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '5', 'file_name': '6636d92f-27a6-4e61-acbb-72756f6e3125_The Economics of Private Equity_ A Critical Review.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\\nCFA Institute Research Foundation  5A hallmark of PE deals that sets them apart from venture capital and many growth equity \\ninvestments is that they are typically financed through a combination of equity and plenty \\nof debt.13 In 2022, for example, leverage ratios (i.e., debt divided by EBITDA) averaged 5.9 in US \\nprivate equity deals according to PitchBook.14 Typically, the debt financing is initially provided by \\none or more banks and then syndicated and often sold.\\nEven part of the eventual equity investment in a deal is often initially funded by debt, using \\nwhat are called “equity bridge facilities” or “subscription line facilities. ” These short-term loans \\nare secured on a fund’ s LP commitments that are repaid once the GP initiates a capital call. By \\nallowing the GP to delay a capital call, subscription lines boost the fund’ s reported IRR by short -\\nening the time during which fund capital is invested in a deal. The effect on reported IRRs can be \\nlarge: Albertus and Denes (2024) estimate that using subscription lines increases reported IRRs \\nby 1.9 percentage points on average.\\nAs a PE fund’ s portfolio companies mature, they are readied for exit and then sold on the stock \\nmarket or to a strategic buyer or a financial buyer (another PE firm’ s fund). Most LPAs require \\nexit proceeds to be distributed to the fund’ s partners (in accordance with the waterfall) instead \\nof being reinvested into the fund. Plotting the net of a fund’ s cumulative drawdowns and its \\ncumulative distributions results in the famous J-curve. Figure 1 , reproduced from Ljungqvist, \\nRichardson, and Wolfenzon (2020), plots the average J-curve for a sample of PE funds raised \\nbetween 1981 and 2000. Over that period, it took more than seven years for the average fund \\nto “return capital, ” with capital gains accruing in the final few years of the fund’ s life. Investing in \\nprivate equity thus requires an LP to have both patience and a long investment horizon.\\nIn steady state, an LP’ s portfolio of PE funds of different vintage years would generate suffi -\\ncient distributions from older funds to meet capital calls from younger funds in expectation. \\nIn a steady-state portfolio, the LP is thus mainly exposed to the liquidity risk associated with \\nthe curves in Figure 1 shifting as drawdowns happen unexpectedly early and/or distributions \\nare delayed or come in lower than expected, say as a result of a recession. Moreover, sudden \\nchanges in industry practices—such as the current waning popularity of subscription lines \\nbecause interest rates have increased from record lows—can shift the J-curve in unexpected \\nways and thereby put strain on LPs’ liquidity management.\\nLPs cannot easily sell their fund interests. The LPA almost always gives the GP the right to veto \\nthe transfer of an LP’ s fund interest. This is not to say that no such transfers take place—indeed, \\nfunds specializing in acquiring “secondary” stakes in PE funds raised a cumulative $227 billion \\nduring 2018–2022, according to Secondaries Investor15—but there is no liquid marketplace \\nin fund interests. Instead, specialized investment banking teams broker secondary sales by \\napproaching potential buyers and inviting them to submit indicative bids, with the seller then \\nnegotiating with shortlisted bidders. According to Lerner and Schoar (2004), who study the \\nUnited States, one reason why PE firms have resisted the emergence of a marketplace for fund \\ninterests may be tax law: US limited partnerships would lose their flow-through (untaxed) status \\nunder IRC Section 7704 if they were considered “publicly traded. ”\\n13Axelson, Jenkinson, Weisbach, and Strömberg (2013) provide a comprehensive discussion of the use of leverage in \\nprivate equity deals.\\n14Source: https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/pe-quantitative-data-deal-count-exit-liquidity-2023-forecast .\\n15Source: www.secondariesinvestor.com/pe-secondaries-funds-reach-best-q1-q3-period-ever .', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='0b2a2c7f-0e6b-4427-a3a7-ab4cff7e93c0', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': '6636d92f-27a6-4e61-acbb-72756f6e3125_The Economics of Private Equity_ A Critical Review.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\\n6  CFA Institute Research FoundationFigure 1.

A large proportion of academic \\nresearch relies on data from such vendors. Selection and reporting biases are a natural concern when using such data.How does private equity perform as an asset class? This seemingly straightforward question \\nproves difficult to answer, for four principal reasons.\\n• Private equity is an opaque asset class: Although a PE fund has a duty to report its perfor -\\nmance to its LPs (and, in the United States since 2012, to the SEC), it has no obligation to \\ndisclose its performance to the public. LPAs often explicitly bar LPs from sharing perfor -\\nmance data they receive from a PE fund (and the SEC does not make individual fund disclo -\\nsures public). Data availability thus constrains performance measurement.\\n• Private equity largely invests in private assets: Not being traded in financial markets, private \\nassets cannot be marked to market easily, and estimating their value before exit is difficult.\\n• Private equity invests in illiquid assets: Illiquidity exposes a PE fund to the risk that there \\nmay be insufficient demand at an acceptable valuation when a portfolio company is ready to \\nbe exited.\\n• Private equity has long investment horizons: As the J-curve illustrates, PE funds are usually \\ncash flow negative for many years before they begin returning capital, and they typically \\ngenerate capital gains only toward the end of their lives.\\nIndustry Practices\\nThe PE industry usually reports three key performance indicators (KPIs) to LPs: IRR, TVPI, \\nand DPI.16\\nIRR stands for internal rate of return and is well known from standard MBA textbooks. It mea -\\nsures the fund’ s annualized rate of return, considering the timing and magnitude of the fund’ s \\ncash flows (i.e., its drawdowns and net-of-fees distributions). As such, an IRR can be computed \\nonly once a fund has been wound down at the end of its life, yet it is standard industry practice \\nto report IRRs throughout a fund’ s life. To this end, a fund treats the estimated value of its unre -\\nalized portfolio holdings as a future terminal cash flow.\\nBecause portfolio holdings are private and illiquid, estimating their value accurately can be \\nchallenging. Interim IRRs are thus, at minimum, noisy estimates of future performance. As I will \\ndiscuss later, practitioners often worry that interim IRRs are manipulated, especially ahead of \\na PE firm’ s next fundraise. Even “final” IRRs may be misleading: LPs often worry that a GP may \\nmanipulate the fund’ s lifetime IRR—for example, by using subscription lines or by choosing the \\ntiming and size of the fund’ s investments in self-serving ways.\\nTVPI stands for total value to paid-in capital. It equals the total value of the net-of-fees distri -\\nbutions received by a fund’ s LPs to date plus the estimated value of unrealized portfolio hold -\\nings, divided by LPs’ capital contributions. A TVPI greater than 1 indicates that the fund has ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='aed37778-2b0c-4075-a445-9124c9b3e839', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '8', 'file_name': '6636d92f-27a6-4e61-acbb-72756f6e3125_The Economics of Private Equity_ A Critical Review.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\\n8  CFA Institute Research Foundationgenerated positive returns. Like IRR, TVPI is subject to the challenge that unrealized portfolio \\nholdings are private and illiquid and thus difficult to value accurately. Unlike IRR, TVPI ignores \\nthe time value of money. The same TVPI can thus yield very different returns. For example, \\ndoubling the fund’ s value over one year implies a 100% annualized return, whereas doubling its \\nvalue over two years implies only a 41% annualized return. As every PE fund manager knows, \\ntime is the enemy of returns.\\nDPI stands for distributed to paid-in capital. It equals the total value of the net-of-fees dis -\\ntributions received by a fund’ s LPs to date divided by LPs’ capital contributions. Unlike TVPI, \\nDPI ignores unrealized portfolio holdings. Like TVPI, DPI ignores the time value of money. The \\nJ-curve shows the evolution of DPI along the positive part of its y-axis and to the right of the \\nbreakeven point.\\nIRR, TVPI, and DPI are all absolute KPIs—they do not adjust for the market return or for risk. \\nAccording to survey evidence reported in Gompers, Kaplan, and Mukharlyamov (2016), LPs \\nfocus more on absolute KPIs than on risk-adjusted returns. To the extent that practitioners talk \\nabout relative performance, they have in mind benchmarking a PE fund’ s IRR, TVPI, and DPI \\nagainst other PE funds. A fund placing in the top or second quartile might then be deemed to be \\nperforming well relative to other funds.\\nThis benchmarking practice is quite different from how financial economists think about \\nbenchmarking performance. A financial economist’ s natural inclination would be to compute \\nannualized risk-adjusted returns, to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison, and then to com -\\npare them not only within the PE asset class but also across all relevant asset classes. After all, \\ninvesting in a PE fund involves the opportunity cost of not investing in another asset class \\n(e.g., infrastructure or timber) that might be yielding a higher return for the same levels of risk \\nand liquidity.\\nAcademic Views of PE Performance\\nStandard academic practice is to benchmark a PE fund’ s performance against the performance \\nof a strategy that invests the same amount of capital in a stock market index using the same \\ndrawdown and distribution schedules as the PE fund. The earliest implementation of this \\napproach appears in Long and Nickels (1996), but the implementation that has become the \\nstandard measure in much of academic research is Kaplan and Schoar’ s (2005) public market \\nequivalent (PME).\\nPME equals the ratio of the fund’ s net-of-fees distributions, discounted at the contemporaneous \\nrealized return on a suitable stock market index, and the fund’ s drawdowns, discounted at the \\ncontemporaneous realized return on the same stock market index.17 A PME greater than 1 indi -\\ncates that the fund has generated a return in excess of the stock market index return.\\nPME is more than just intuitively appealing. Sørensen and Jagannathan (2015) show that PME \\nis equivalent to measuring a PE fund’ s risk-adjusted performance using the formal capital asset \\n17Ljungqvist and Richardson (2003), who independently developed a PME measure, note that drawdowns associated \\nwith management fees (rather than with investments in portfolio companies) are a risk-free claim and so should be dis -\\ncounted at the risk-free rate rather than at the index return as in Kaplan and Schoar’ s (2005) PME.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='caf26f10-94c1-4684-8e5f-81f35d24ac1b', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '9', 'file_name': '6636d92f-27a6-4e61-acbb-72756f6e3125_The Economics of Private Equity_ A Critical Review.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\\nCFA Institute Research Foundation  9pricing model of Rubinstein (1976).18 PME has a number of desirable properties: It does not \\nrequire data on the riskiness of the individual portfolio companies or any estimation of any \\nbetas or the market risk premium. It is invariant to changes over time in the riskiness of a fund’ s \\ninvestments (e.g., as financial leverage changes). And, it cannot be manipulated by increasing \\nthe fund’ s leverage or choosing the timing or size of the fund’ s investments.\\nBroadly speaking, academic studies find that investors have historically done well when invest -\\ning in PE funds, earning returns after fees that exceed those available contemporaneously in the \\nPE markets. Table 1  summarizes the results of seven highly cited studies that use PME to mea -\\nsure average historical performance in PE funds.\\nWith the exception of the two studies that used data from Venture Economics that are no \\nlonger considered reliable,19 the academic consensus is that investment in private equity funds \\nhas historically yielded returns after fees that exceed those on the S&P 500 Index.20\\nWhether these positive abnormal returns after fees mean that private equity beats the stock \\nmarket in the sense of positive alpha remains an open question. The abnormal returns could \\nsimply compensate LPs for the greater risk, leverage, or illiquidity of PE funds.\\n18Formally, Sørensen and Jagannathan (2015) show that PME is a valid performance measure if the LP has logarithmic \\npreferences, the stock market index is chosen such that the return on the index equals the return on the LP’ s entire port -\\nfolio, and the law of one price holds. Under these conditions, PME values a PE fund’ s risky cash flows using a log-utility \\ninvestor’ s stochastic discount factor. Korteweg and Nagel (2016) derive a generalized PME measure.\\n19Venture Economics data have been shown to suffer from problems stemming from the valuation of unrealized invest -\\nments and from stale data; see Stucke (2011) and Harris, Jenkinson, and Kaplan (2014) for further details. Venture \\nEconomics data are now rarely used in academic research on PE funds. Brown et al.

The three-factor model may provide a better benchmark than the CAPM, to the \\nextent that PE portfolios load on small size and value.\\nGupta and van Nieuwerburgh (2021) consider an even richer set of risk factors and depart from \\nthe literature by using expected returns rather than the realized returns on traded assets that \\nunderpin PME. Their conclusion is that PE funds generate negative abnormal returns after fees \\non a risk-adjusted basis. Boyer et al. (2023) take yet another approach: They infer returns from \\nthe negotiated prices at which LP interests in PE funds change hands in secondary transactions, \\nconcluding that PE funds do not outperform on a risk-adjusted basis.\\nThese and similar studies are difficult to compare because each uses a different dataset and \\nadjusts for risk in a different way, making many different assumptions along the way. Consensus \\non whether PE funds generate positive risk-adjusted alpha after fees thus remains elusive.21\\nThe fact that PE deals are more highly leveraged than the companies in the S&P 500 has long \\ntroubled scholars of PE performance, notwithstanding Sørensen and Jagannathan’ s (2015) ana -\\nlytical finding that PME is invariant to leverage. L ’Her, Stoyanova, Shaw, Scott, and Lai (2016) find \\nzero alpha when using a levered size- and sector-adjusted index to adjust for risk and leverage. \\nIn a thought-provoking study, Stafford (2022) shows that PE funds underperform a lever -\\naged strategy of investing in small value firms that are listed on the stock market. Ang, Chen, \\nGoetzmann, and Phalippou (2018), using a Bayesian approach, reach a different conclusion: \\nIn their model, PE returns cannot be replicated using listed stocks.\\nBesides risk and leverage, positive abnormal returns after fees could compensate LPs for liquid -\\nity risk. Financial economists have studied three types of liquidity risk in this context. The first \\nresults from the exposure of the returns on a PE fund’ s portfolio companies to unexpected fluc -\\ntuations in marketwide liquidity, a factor that Pástor and Stambaugh (2003) show is a priced risk \\nfactor in public equity markets. Franzoni, Nowak, and Phalippou (2012) estimate a four-factor \\nmodel that includes a Pástor–Stambaugh liquidity factor alongside the three Fama–French fac -\\ntors. Finding an insignificant alpha, they conclude that PE funds generate returns after fees that \\ncompensate LPs for this type of liquidity—but no more than that. Ang et al. (2018) also find that \\nPE returns load on a proxy for market illiquidity, but only partly: Some positive alpha remains \\nafter accounting for exposure to marketwide liquidity risk.\\nThe second type of liquidity risk arises because absent a liquid secondary market, LPs cannot \\neasily exit a fund over its 10-year life should their portfolio needs change. Sørensen, Wang, and \\nYang (2014) incorporate this type of liquidity risk into a dynamic portfolio choice model. Their \\nconclusion is that PE funds’ observed abnormal returns after fees are just about large enough to \\ncompensate LPs for being locked into a 10-year commitment that is difficult to hedge.\\nThe third type of liquidity risk relates to the J-curve. Having committed capital to a fund, LPs \\nrun the risk of receiving capital calls when liquidity is expensive. Robinson and Sensoy (2016) \\nargue that this type of liquidity risk is unlikely to be material on average because drawdowns \\n21For an in-depth technical review of empirical methods to risk-adjust PE returns, see Korteweg (2019).', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='a3f7c18a-533e-4156-8273-ff54a1a2bba6', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '11', 'file_name': '6636d92f-27a6-4e61-acbb-72756f6e3125_The Economics of Private Equity_ A Critical Review.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\\nCFA Institute Research Foundation  11(and distributions) are procyclical. As they put it, capital calls made in good times carry a \\nrelatively low opportunity cost. Moreover, they find that much of this type of liquidity risk is \\nfund-specific and can thus be diversified away by holding a portfolio that is diversified across \\nfunds within vintage and across vintages. Still, some funds will be prone to making capital calls \\nwhen economic conditions are weak, and most LPs thus value liquidity more highly. Robinson \\nand Sensoy (2016) show that LPs in such funds earn a return premium for such countercyclical \\nbehavior.\\nReturn Persistence and Performance Drivers\\nBeyond the question regarding whether PE funds deliver positive alpha after fees, academic \\nstudies have investigated two properties of PE performance: return persistence across a PE \\nfirm’ s funds over time, and the drivers of return differences across funds of different vintages. \\nKaplan and Schoar (2005) were the first to study persistence, finding that in the 1980s and \\n1990s, PE firms that outperformed their peers in one fund were likely to continue outperforming \\ntheir peers in subsequent funds.22 Persistence is seen as indicative of GP skill. Using different \\ndata and empirical approaches, Robinson and Sensoy (2016), Korteweg and Sørensen (2017), \\nand Gupta and van Nieuwerburgh (2021) likewise find evidence of persistence, although Harris, \\nJenkinson, Kaplan, and Stucke (2023) and Braun, Jenkinson, and Stoff (2017) show that per -\\nsistence has weakened over time at the fund and the deal level, respectively. The return spread \\ncan be large: Korteweg and Sørensen (2017) estimate that top-quartile funds persistently out -\\nperform bottom-quartile funds by 7–8 percentage points a year. Return persistence in private \\nequity contrasts sharply with that of mutual funds, for which past performance is viewed as a \\npoor predictor of future performance.\\nWhether LPs can exploit persistence in practice is open to question: Many studies estimate \\npersistence from the realized returns funds will earn over their approximately 10-year lifetimes, \\nyet PE firms raise new funds every 3–5 years, well before the final returns on their current \\nfunds are realized and publicly known. When deciding to invest in a new fund, LPs therefore \\nhave to make do with publicly available data on the current fund’ s interim KPIs (such as net-of-\\nfee IRRs to date, TVPI, and DPI). Interim performance is a much noisier predictor of the next \\nfund’ s performance than the current fund’ s lifetime return once realized in the future. Based \\non this insight, Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Vissing-Jørgensen (2014) propose a model in which \\nLPs that invest in a PE firm’ s current fund have an information advantage over other potential \\ninvestors in the next fund, in the form of access to “soft” information about the GP’ s ability to \\npersistently generate high returns. This information advantage gives current LPs bargaining \\npower vis-à-vis the GP . The model can explain the empirical regularity that PE firms tend not \\nto raise their fees in line with their performance and instead “price” their funds to have excess \\ndemand from LPs. Investors in earlier funds then earn abnormal returns in later funds as they \\ncan “hold up” the GP by threatening not to invest in the next fund, which other market partici -\\npants with access only to public information would interpret as a negative signal in the familiar \\nadverse-selection sense.\\n22Part of the observed return persistence is mechanical because consecutive funds are raised only a few years apart and \\nso are subject to similar macroeconomic conditions.

Consistent with Gompers and Lerner’ s (2000) idea that too much money \\nspent chasing deals simply drives up entry multiples, Ljungqvist and Richardson (2003) find that \\nthe more money raised in a fund’ s vintage year, the worse the fund’ s subsequent performance. \\nAxelson et al.

The value bridge decomposes the change in a portfolio company’ s value between \\nacquisition and exit into the change in EBITDA profitability that accompanies revenue growth \\nand cost reductions during the ownership period (“margin expansion”), the change from the \\nentry multiple to the exit multiple (“multiples expansion”), and the reduction in debt.27\\nThe change in valuation between acquisition and exit is an absolute measure of value creation, \\njust as IRR, TVPI, and DPI are absolute measures of performance. An obvious shortcoming of an \\nabsolute measure of value creation is that profitability and multiples might increase for reasons \\nunrelated to PE ownership and so would have increased anyway: Maybe the portfolio company \\nwas bought at the bottom of the business cycle and its profitability increased simply because \\nthe economy recovered; maybe multiples expanded because the stock market boomed during \\nthe ownership period.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='8c634f3c-2e91-485f-88c0-2e35aebd8638', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '14', 'file_name': '6636d92f-27a6-4e61-acbb-72756f6e3125_The Economics of Private Equity_ A Critical Review.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\\n14  CFA Institute Research FoundationAcademic Views of PE Value Creation\\nTo a financial economist, absolute measures of value creation and accounting-based \\napproaches such as the value bridge are meaningless. Only that part of the valuation increase \\nthat would not have happened but for  a PE fund’ s investment in a portfolio company can be \\nattributed to the PE fund as its value creation. Measuring the extent to which private equity \\ncreates economic value thus requires a benchmark, or counterfactual, for what would have hap -\\npened absent the PE fund’ s investment. In other words, measuring value creation is inherently a \\nrelative exercise.\\nThe “but for” qualifier is key: If PE funds simply invest in portfolio companies whose operations \\nand performance were about to improve regardless of PE ownership, they are simply stock \\npickers and cannot be credited with creating economic value. In academic parlance, stock \\npicking leads to a selection effect (returns to LPs are high because PE funds pick future \\nwinners), while value creation manifests as a treatment effect (returns to LPs are high because \\nPE funds causally  increase the value of their portfolio companies during the ownership period).\\nBut even if PE funds create economic value at their portfolio companies in this causal-treatment \\nsense, it is possible that they do so at the expense of another party. In other words, creating \\n“private value” for their investors need not imply that PE funds create “social value” for the econ -\\nomy as a whole. The creation of social value can be likened to increasing the size of the eco -\\nnomic pie. Activities that do not increase the size of the economic pie may create private value \\nfor investors, but they do not create social value for the wider economy. Instead, such activities \\ncreate value for one party at the expense of another.\\nAn example of an activity that arguably does not increase the size of the pie is stock picking. \\nSuppose a GP is simply good at spotting undervalued companies and effects no productive \\nchanges at its portfolio companies during the ownership period. Such a GP may well generate \\npositive abnormal returns after fees for its LPs, but their gain exactly equals the loss suffered \\nby shareholders who unwittingly sold too cheaply. A similar argument applies to market timing. \\nSuppose a GP is simply good at exiting its portfolio companies when multiples are about to \\npeak but has effected no productive changes during the ownership period.28 Like stock picking, \\nmarket timing redistributes value from one party to another without creating social value.\\nFinally, even if private equity were found to create value in the economic-pie-size-increase \\nsense, there may still be winners and losers—say, in the form of satisfied investors and custom -\\ners on the one hand and workers who are laid off during portfolio company restructuring on the \\nother hand. This raises the question of to what extent private equity imposes negative external -\\nities on parts of the economy.29 For example, leveraging up portfolio companies may improve \\n28In reality, GPs may or may not be good at timing.

On the one hand, Gredil (2022) reports that GPs are \\ngood at timing their exits to coincide with industry-level peaks in public-market valuations, perhaps because sitting on \\nthe boards of many public firms, they may learn non-public information that helps predict industry-level returns.

In this section, I review studies of the changes portfolio \\ncompanies undergo while under PE ownership. Although fascinating, much of this body of work \\nstruggles to disentangle selection and treatment. The extent to which PE funds create private \\nvalue, rather than picking winners, thus remains an open question.\\nThe early literature focused on two PE value-creation strategies: financial engineering and \\ngovernance engineering. Lowenstein (1985) noted that leveraging portfolio companies could \\nincrease company value by increasing interest-related tax deductions. Studying the kind of \\nleveraged buyouts of stock market listed firms that were characteristic of the 1980s, Kaplan \\n(1989b) estimated the tax benefits to account for 21% to 143% of the premium paid to share -\\nholders in the median leveraged buyout. In other words, tax benefits appear to be a main source \\nof the expected gains in the leveraged buyouts Kaplan (1989b) studied.30\\nThe 1980s were also marked by a high level of hostility in leveraged buyouts. The public cor -\\nporation was seen by many as rife with agency conflicts between managers and dispersed, \\npassive shareholders. Michael Jensen’ s influential 1986 article, “ Agency Costs of Free Cash Flow, \\nCorporate Finance, and Takeovers, ” provided the intellectual foundation for the view that public \\ncompanies were ineffectively governed. The solution, according to Jensen (1989), was private \\nequity, which could eliminate “much of the loss created by conflicts between owners and man -\\nagers” by better alignment of interests between managers and active owners.\\nKaplan (1989a) attributed the large improvement in industry-adjusted operating performance \\nin his sample of 1980s buyouts to better incentives. These incentives can be substantial: \\nGompers, Kaplan, and Mukharlyamov (2016) report that PE funds on average allocate 17% of \\nportfolio company equity to management and employees.\\nAlthough financial and governance engineering have not gone away, recent research has \\nfocused more on operational engineering: Do PE funds make their portfolio companies more \\nefficient? To see why this question is challenging to answer convincingly, consider the well-\\ncited study by Bloom, Sadun, and van Reenen (2015). The authors report that according to their \\nmanagement-evaluation index, PE portfolio companies are better managed than companies \\nwith other types of owners. But because their data are cross-sectional, the authors cannot \\nfor everyone, an example of a positive externality. Air pollution from a factory increases medical costs in surrounding \\nareas, an example of a negative externality.\\n30Financial engineering need not solely be about exploiting as yet unexploited tax shields. As Ivashina and Kovner (2011) \\nshow, companies can borrow more cheaply once acquired by a PE fund, as lenders set loan terms based on their knowl -\\nedge of the PE firm’ s performance in past deals and as banks hope to sell other services to the PE firm.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='829c5fa3-a288-4054-8770-7a3265c2039d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '16', 'file_name': '6636d92f-27a6-4e61-acbb-72756f6e3125_The Economics of Private Equity_ A Critical Review.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\\n16  CFA Institute Research Foundationdisentangle whether PE ownership improves management practices in a treatment sense or \\nwhether instead PE funds selectively invest in companies that are already well managed to \\nbegin with.\\nAs the example of Bloom, Sadun, and van Reenen’ s (2015) study shows, establishing a PE treat -\\nment effect at minimum requires observing portfolio companies before, during, and (ideally) \\nafter PE ownership (and even then, selection effects are difficult to rule out, as I will argue). \\nMethodologically, the current state of the art in the literature is to compare the evolution of \\nPE portfolio companies during the PE ownership period to that of “control” firms with similar \\ncharacteristics that did not receive PE investment. Any remaining differences in performance \\nbetween the two groups are then attributed to PE ownership. The implicit assumption is that \\nabsent PE ownership , portfolio companies would have performed similarly to the control com -\\npanies on average. The characteristics typically controlled for in this “control firm” approach \\ninclude, at minimum, size, industry, and year.\\nWhen measured this way, there is ample evidence that portfolio companies undergo significant \\noperational changes during the PE ownership period. Using proprietary data on 395 portfolio \\ncompanies of 48 European PE funds, Acharya, Gottschalg, Hahn, and Kehoe (2013) report that \\nportfolio companies grow sales and profitability faster than the median stock market listed \\nfirm in the same industry during the ownership period. Using confidential data from corporate \\nincome tax returns, Cohn, Hotchkiss, and Towery (2022) report similar evidence for the United \\nStates, showing that portfolio companies experience rapid growth in sales and moderate \\ngrowth in profitability compared with control firms matched on industry and prior profitability \\nand leverage. Using French tax data, Boucly, Sraer, and Thesmar (2011) find that similar patterns \\nhold in France.31\\nWhat might underlie these headline increases in profitability? In an early study, Lichtenberg and \\nSiegel (1990) use data from the US Census Bureau to show that manufacturing plants owned \\nby PE portfolio companies through the 1980s increased their total factor productivity (i.e., their \\noutput per unit of total input) by significantly more than the industry average as white-collar \\nemployment and wages fell. Using more recent US Census Bureau data, Davis, Haltiwanger, \\nHandley, Jarmin, Lerner, and Miranda (2014) confirm that portfolio companies experience an \\nincrease in productivity compared with control firms matched on industry, size, age, and prior \\ngrowth. Their establishment-level data allow them to show that productivity grows as portfolio \\ncompanies exit their less productive units, expand their more productive units, and create new, \\nmore productive establishments. This reshuffling of production assets entails high gross labor \\nturnover as employees are hired and fired, although the net job loss is found to be relatively small.\\nUsing similar data for a longer period, Davis, Haltiwanger, Handley, Lipsius, Lerner, and Miranda \\n(2021) show that employment declines after buyouts of listed companies and expands after \\nbuyouts of unlisted companies. Gornall, Gredil, Howell, Liu, and Sockin (Forthcoming) find that \\nalthough wages are unchanged on average, job satisfaction ratings drop at portfolio companies.\\n31The only setting in which portfolio companies do not appear to experience much growth is in public-to-private transac -\\ntions. In the United States, when PE funds take stock market listed firms private, operating margins do not improve sig -\\nnificantly (Cohn, Mills, and Towery 2014; Guo, Hotchkiss, and Song 2011). These findings contrast with older evidence \\nreported in Kaplan (1989a), which suggested that public-to-private deals were associated with performance improve -\\nments in the 1980s.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='31aabf10-3a39-4a6f-bb26-cd9040de977d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '17', 'file_name': '6636d92f-27a6-4e61-acbb-72756f6e3125_The Economics of Private Equity_ A Critical Review.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\\nCFA Institute Research Foundation  17For Sweden, Olsson and Tåg (2017) report similarly small net employment changes overall, but \\nthey also find large increases in the likelihood of unemployment for workers at less productive \\nportfolio companies and among workers who perform easily offshorable routine tasks. For \\nGermany, Antoni, Maug, and Obernberger (2019) find reductions in employment and compen -\\nsation during the ownership period, especially among managers and older workers. For France, \\nBoucly, Sraer, and Thesmar (2011) find faster  (net) growth in employment among portfolio com -\\npanies along with an increase in capital expenditure during the ownership period. Overall, the \\neffect of private equity on employment appears to be highly context dependent.\\nWhat about innovation? For the United States, Lichtenberg and Siegel (1990) report that in the \\n1980s, PE portfolio companies increased their innovation intensity (as measured by the ratio \\nof R&D spending to sales) more during the ownership period than the average firm did. Lerner, \\nSørensen, and Strömberg (2011) report that portfolio companies produced higher-quality inno -\\nvation (as measured by patent citations). For the United Kingdom, Amess, Stiebale, and Wright \\n(2016) report a significant increase in innovation (as measured by patenting) during the owner -\\nship period.\\nCollectively, these studies show that portfolio companies undergo significant changes while \\nowned by a PE fund. This insight raises two questions: Do company-level operational improve -\\nments affect the financial returns a PE fund generates for its LPs? And are these company-level \\noperational improvements caused  by the PE fund (treatment), or would they have happened \\nanyway (selection)?\\nIn an important study, Acharya et al. (2013) tackle the first question. They report that PE \\nfunds earn higher financial returns the more a portfolio company’ s sales and profitability have \\nincreased during the ownership period. This dynamic establishes a potential link between the \\nchanges portfolio companies undergo while owned by a PE fund and the returns that the fund’ s \\nLPs earn.\\nWhether the link is real or spurious depends on whether the changes would have happened \\nanyway. Surely it is true that PE funds select portfolio companies based at least in part on fac -\\ntors that outsiders (such as financial economists) do not observe and so cannot hold constant. \\nSpecifically, suppose PE funds selectively invest in companies that have reached an inflection \\npoint at which past managerial decisions and actions will result in above-average growth in \\nsales and profitability. If so, PE funds do not cause  the observed operational improvements, and \\nthe observed link between growth and investor returns reflects stock-picking skills rather than \\ntrue economic value creation.\\nFor the second question, disentangling selection and treatment is methodologically challenging \\nfor obvious reasons: We can never observe the counterfactual world in which a PE fund’ s port -\\nfolio company is not acquired by the PE fund. Biesinger, Bircan, and Ljungqvist (2023) use confi -\\ndential textual data contained in pre-deal investment memos and value creation plans in a first \\nattempt to disentangle selection and treatment. The unique feature of these textual data is that \\nthey reveal what plans were already  underway at a prospective portfolio company and what \\nadditional actions the PE fund intended to take during the ownership period in order to create \\nvalue in ways that would not have happened but for its investment.\\nBiesinger, Bircan, and Ljungqvist (2023) find that the typical operational improvements usually \\nattributed to private equity reflect a mixture of treatment and selection effects.

According to Biesinger, Bircan, \\nand Ljungqvist (2023), much of what happens to a portfolio company’ s income statement \\nduring the ownership period thus appears to have little to do with PE ownership. It is only on \\na portfolio company’ s balance sheet that PE ownership appears to make a difference—both in \\nterms of leverage and in terms of higher asset growth driven by increased capital expenditure \\nand acquisitions and divestitures of operating units. Tying company-level changes to deal-level \\nreturns, Biesinger, Bircan, and Ljungqvist (2023) conclude that PE funds create financial value \\nfor their LPs through a combination of stock-picking skills and value-add activities focused on \\nthe asset side of the balance sheet, while financial engineering activities on the liability side of \\nthe balance sheet do not increase deal-level returns.\\nEvidence of Social Value Creation\\nDoes private equity contribute to the common good? No single study can answer this import -\\nant question comprehensively. Instead, financial economists have studied specific settings to \\nhelp determine whether the creation of private value for investors entails externalities (negative \\nor otherwise).\\nOne line of enquiry emphasizes that operational improvements at PE portfolio companies \\nmay generate positive externalities for other companies in the same industry. By helping their \\nportfolio companies become more formidable competitors, the argument goes, PE firms raise \\noperational and managerial standards industrywide. Consistent with this argument, Bernstein, \\nLerner, Sørensen, and Strömberg (2017) and Aldatmaz and Brown (2020) report that industries \\nwith greater PE activity increase sales and employment significantly faster.\\nThere has been a recent boom in studies that exploit detailed non-accounting data to shed \\nlight on winners and losers in the wake of PE investments. Fracassi, Previtero, and Sheen (2022) \\nstudy PE investments in consumer goods companies. Using supermarket scanner data, they \\nshow that PE portfolio companies raise prices to end-consumers only marginally, suggesting \\nthat the overall growth in sales documented in studies such as Acharya et al. (2013) may reflect \\na quantity effect rather than a price effect. If so, value for investors might not be created at the \\nexpense of consumers. Moreover, portfolio companies are more likely to introduce new prod -\\nucts and to increase product variety than similar non-PE companies, which may increase eco -\\nnomic welfare if consumers derive utility from new products and greater variety.\\nCohn, Nestoriak, and Wardlaw (2021) study workplace safety, reporting that PE portfolio com -\\npanies experience a reduction in Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) safety \\nviolations and worker injury rates during the ownership period, compared with control firms \\nmatched on industry and size. In a similar spirit, Bernstein and Sheen (2016) report that health \\ninspection records improve at restaurant chains acquired by PE funds. These findings suggest \\nthat PE funds do not seek to create value for investors at the expense of safety standards for \\nworkers or diners.\\nKirti and Sarin (2024) study PE investment in life insurance companies, finding that the main \\nsources of value creation are financial engineering and a post-Global Financial Crisis regulatory \\nloophole allowing insurers to shift their investment portfolios into lower-grade bonds without \\ntriggering higher capital requirements.

The authors do not consider whether nursing home \\nacquisitions create value for investors, however.

Although PE has historically generated positive \\nabnormal returns after fees on average, the return spread between bottom-quartile and \\ntop-quartile funds is large. Manager selection is thus critical, as are other aspects of a PE invest -\\nment program (liquidity management, mentioned earlier, being an obvious example).\\nPerhaps not surprisingly, then, research suggests that an LP’ s performance when investing \\nin private equity depends on the LP’ s sophistication. Lerner, Schoar, and Wongsunwai (2007) \\nreport that in the 1990s, private university endowments realized returns on their PE portfo -\\nlios that were 4.4% higher than the average LP’ s (although, according to Sensoy, Wang, and \\nWeisbach [2014], this return differential has since narrowed substantially). Cavagnaro, Sensoy, \\nWang, and Weisbach (2019) infer LP skill from the statistical fact that the rate at which some \\nLPs consistently invest in top-performing PE funds is greater than chance (i.e., luck) alone \\nwould predict if all LPs shared the same skill. The authors conclude that an LP’ s skill in selecting \\nthe best GPs is an important driver of LP returns.\\nIn this section, I review academic research on various aspects of investing in PE that are of rele -\\nvance and concern to LPs when forming and managing a portfolio of PE funds.\\nManager Selection\\nIf it is true that PE performance is persistent, shouldn’t it be easy to select follow-on funds \\nsimply based on the previous fund’ s performance? Korteweg and Sørensen (2017) tackle this \\nquestion by estimating whether persistence is investable in the sense that past performance \\nis sufficiently informative to identify GPs with the skill needed to reliably generate high returns \\nin the future. They find little investable persistence, partly because performance is noisy and \\npartly because few GPs are skilled. This conclusion shifts the focus of manager selection away \\nfrom past performance and toward detailed due diligence to understand a GP’ s access to \\nhigh-quality deal flow; its value-creation strategy, team, and resources; and thus its potential \\nfor generating high returns on its next fund. In other words, it takes skill to identify a skilled \\nGP . If so, it is not surprising that LPs differ systematically in the performance they earn on their \\nPE portfolios.\\nIf the necessary skills are subject to scale economies, we expect institutional investors that \\ninvest in these skills to allocate a larger fraction of their portfolio to private equity and to expe -\\nrience better performance.

As noted earlier, this principal–\\nagent relationship is governed by the LPA, which is signed at the closing of the fund, stays in \\nforce for the fund’ s 12-or-so-year term, and gives the GP broad discretion over how the fund \\nis managed. The twin insights (1) that an agent will not, in gener al, behave in the principal’ s \\nbest interest when the principal cannot fully observe the agent’ s actions and the agent is \\nbetter informed and (2) that contracts (such as an LPA) designed to incentivize and constrain \\nan agent’ s self-interested behavior will necessarily be incomplete are a foundation of modern \\ncorporate finance going back to the 1970s. LPs should thus be prepared for conflicts of interest \\nwhen investing in PE funds.34\\nThe structure of GP compensation can easily give rise to misaligned incentives. GPs receive \\nconvex payoffs, both directly through their carried interest (which pays them a fixed percent -\\nage of capital gains—say 20%, when the fund does well—without penalizing them when the \\nfund does poorly) and indirectly through their ability to raise a larger follow-on fund (with larger \\ndollar management fees) when their current fund performs well (Metrick and Yasuda 2010).35 \\nWhen payoffs are convex in this way, agents can find it in their interest to take greater risks than \\nprincipals would want them to: “Heads I win, tails you lose. ”\\nThe use of leverage may aggravate this problem, especially when debt is cheap (Axelson et al. \\n2013).

The same appears to be true for the carried interest, which also does not predict after-\\nfee returns. The finer details of GPs’ compensation formulas, however, appear to distort GP \\nincentives. Robinson and Sensoy (2013) also find that PE funds time their portfolio exits in a \\nself-serving manner. They tend to accelerate portfolio company sales during the “catch-up” \\nperiod of their compensation waterfall (which has the effect of increasing their carried-interest \\npayoff). In addition, PE funds tend to delay the sale (or write-off) of underperforming portfolio \\ncompanies once the basis for the management fee switches from committed capital to net \\ninvested capital (which has the effect of increasing the amount of management fees that PE \\nfunds can charge).\\nA different type of conflict of interest can arise in connection with follow-on fundraising. To stay \\nin business long term, a GP has to raise follow-on funds; the performance of the GP’ s current \\nfund affects the GP’ s ability to raise the next fund (Chung, Sensoy, Stern, and Weisbach 2012; \\nHochberg, Ljungqvist, and Vissing-Jørgensen 2014; Barber and Yasuda 2017). The problem for \\npotential LPs is that GPs, in order to be able to invest beyond their current fund’ s commitment \\nperiod, need to raise their next fund before the current fund has realized all its investments. The \\ncurrent fund’ s reported performance thus consists of (objective) cash flows from realized invest -\\nments and (more or less subjective) accounting valuations of unrealized portfolio companies. \\nThis situation raises the concern that GPs may game reported valuations.36\\nThe academic evidence on this type of gaming is mixed. Using fund-level data, Barber and \\nYasuda (2017) report that PE firms time their fundraising to coincide with a peak in their current \\nfund’ s reported performance—and not just because they naturally tend to fundraise in the wake \\nof successful exits. Even for funds with few successful exits (and those with low reputation), \\nfundraising still coincides with peak performance, leading Barber and Yasuda (2017) to conclude \\nthat desperate GPs inflate their reported net asset values (NAVs). Also using fund-level data, \\nBrown, Gredil, and Kaplan (2019) similarly find that although struggling GPs inflate NAVs during \\nfundraising, LPs aren’t fooled by the deception. Albertus and Denes (2024) show that GPs use \\nsubscription lines to juice up their reported IRRs ahead of fundraising.\\nHüther (2023) comes to a very different conclusion using deal-level rather than fund-level data. \\nThe author shows that in club deals (i.e., when two or more GPs invest in the same portfolio \\ncompany), there is no significant difference in the valuations reported by different GPs for the \\nsame deal, regardless of whether a GP is engaged in fundraising. Why then does fund-level data \\nsuggest NAV manipulation? Hüther (2023) argues that it is not NAVs that are being inflated \\nahead of fundraising. Instead, struggling GPs rush to do bad (i.e., overpriced) deals ahead of \\nfundraising, because contractually, fundraising cannot begin until a pre-agreed fraction of the \\ncurrent fund’ s committed capital is invested. These deals subsequently underperform (i.e., have \\nto be marked down), creating the appearance of the PE firm raising its next fund at the current \\nfund’ s valuation peak.\\n36In a speech in 2013, a senior SEC official expressed the concern as follows: “One type of manager misconduct that \\nwe’ve observed involves writing up assets during a fund raising period and then writing them down soon after the fund \\nraising period closes. ” See www.sec.gov/news/speech/2013-spch012313bkhtm .', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='32ab8e60-8dc5-4ddc-bbc2-b013b3e61400', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '24', 'file_name': '6636d92f-27a6-4e61-acbb-72756f6e3125_The Economics of Private Equity_ A Critical Review.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\\n24  CFA Institute Research FoundationDisintermediation\\nOne of the most prominent changes in the PE industry since the Global Financial Crisis, which \\nbrought club deals to an end, is that co-investment programs have become a staple feature. \\nSuch programs allow selected LPs to invest directly in a portfolio company alongside the PE \\nfund, usually on a “no-fee-no-carry” basis. An LP who co-invests will thus pay a lower blended \\nfee on the combination of its direct and indirect stakes in the portfolio company. The GP , in turn, \\ncan draw on a larger pool of capital and thus do larger deals or keep within the fund’ s concentra -\\ntion limits.\\nCo-investment requires skill and resources: Once offered the opportunity to co-invest in a deal, \\nthe LP conducts its own due diligence on the deal before deciding whether or not to co-invest. \\nNot surprisingly, therefore, co-investment programs are more common among larger, more \\nsophisticated LPs (especially sovereign wealth funds).\\nWhether LPs are offered above- or below-average quality deals to co-invest in and whether LPs \\nare good at selecting high-quality deals from among those offered are still largely open ques -\\ntions. The early evidence is mixed. Fang, Ivashina, and Lerner (2015) analyze 286 co-investment \\ndeals by seven LPs completed between 1991 and 2011. Consistent with these LPs being \\noffered an adverse selection of GPs’ deals, Fang, Ivashina, and Lerner (2015) report that these \\nco-investments underperformed the corresponding funds.37 Braun, Jenkinson, and Schemmerl \\n(2020), however, analyze a larger sample—1,016 co-investments by 458 LPs—and find no evi -\\ndence of adverse selection: The co-investments in their sample performed in line with the \\ncorresponding funds.38\\nCo-investment can be seen as partial disintermediation. Some LPs have gone further, originat -\\ning deals themselves without involving a PE fund, in what are called direct investments. Fang, \\nIvashina, and Lerner (2015) report that the direct investments in their sample outperformed PE \\nfund benchmarks.\\nSecondary Sales\\nAs noted earlier, most private equity funds are illiquid in the sense that LPs cannot easily sell \\ntheir fund interests and thereby transfer their obligations under the LPA to another investor. \\nLerner and Schoar (2004) report that transfers require GP approval in 89% of the 243 LPAs they \\nanalyze. As a result of such transfer restrictions, sales of LP interests (called secondary sales or \\nLP-led secondaries) are essentially bespoke transactions negotiated between buyer and seller, \\nsubject to GP approval. According to McKinsey, $56 billion of secondary sales were completed \\nworldwide in 2022.39\\n37An alternative explanation is that the LPs were offered average-quality deals but chose poorly from among them. \\nFang, Ivashina, and Lerner (2015) do not observe the entire set of deals that were offered, only those that were chosen.\\n38Their finding does not rule out that LPs were offered an adverse selection of deals on average but chose the best ones \\nfrom among them.

Typical buyers include specialized secondary funds, funds of funds, investors seeking \\nto deploy capital faster by acquiring interests in funds that have already come some way along \\ntheir J-curves, investors seeking greater diversification, and investors hoping to gain access to a \\nGP whose funds they have struggled to gain a primary allocation to in the past.\\nSecondary sales can involve a single fund or a portfolio of funds. Typically, transactions are \\npriced at a discount to the fund’ s reported NAV. Analyzing transaction data received from an \\nunnamed intermediary, Nadauld, Sensoy, Vorkink, and Weisbach (2019) report an average dis -\\ncount of 13.8%, although this average includes plenty of fire sales completed during the Global \\nFinancial Crisis—a more typical discount in their data is 9%.

Beginning in the mid-2000s, \\na third type of exit emerged: sponsor-to-sponsor deals (also called secondary buyouts), in \\nwhich a PE firm’ s PE fund sells its portfolio company to another PE firm’ s PE fund. Secondary \\nbuyouts now account for more than half of PE exits.41 More recently, a fourth type of exit has \\nbecome popular: GP-led secondaries, in which a PE firm’ s PE fund sells its portfolio company to \\nanother fund controlled by the same PE firm (essentially, the PE firm sells the portfolio company \\nto itself). The acquiring fund is typically a newly formed “continuation vehicle” that will often \\nown no other assets (i.e., it is a single-asset fund). The LPs in the selling fund are usually invited \\nto invest in the continuation vehicle, although they may be required to simultaneously commit \\ncapital to the GP’ s next fund (a so-called “stapled” transaction). Between 2017 and 2021, GP-led \\nsecondaries grew at a compound annual growth rate of 48%.42\\nBoth secondary buyouts and GP-led secondaries raise issues of interest to LPs. The academic \\nliterature to date has focused on secondary buyouts. LPs may be concerned about secondary \\nbuyouts for three reasons. First, if there are diminishing returns to PE value creation, a second -\\nary buyer may struggle to add much value to a portfolio company, resulting in lower returns. \\nSecond, buying funds may buy because they have capital left to burn toward the end of their \\nlife, rather than because the deal is likely to be good for their LPs. This concern arises because \\nof the one-way-bet nature of GP compensation: It may be tempting (from the viewpoint of a GP \\nthat does not value its reputation too highly) to draw down the last few dollars of capital. If the \\ndeal pays off, the GP will earn carry; if the deal goes south, the GP will have lost “OPM” (other \\npeople’ s money). Third, a well-diversified LP may have a stake in both the selling fund and the \\n40The denominator effect is the term used to describe the following phenomenon: When prices fall faster in the public \\nthan in the private markets, the portfolio weight of an LP’ s PE allocation can hit the LP’ s internal diversification limits.\\n41See www.cfo.com/news/private-equity-exits-down-57-in-2022/654767 / .\\n42See www.nb.com/en/global/insights/whitepaper-the-rise-of-gp-led-secondaries .', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='66c8b4ec-8246-4266-b305-fa77b4c7c0bd', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '26', 'file_name': '6636d92f-27a6-4e61-acbb-72756f6e3125_The Economics of Private Equity_ A Critical Review.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\\n26  CFA Institute Research Foundationbuying fund, with the result that the LP continues to own an indirect stake in the portfolio com -\\npany but bears the transaction costs of the sale.\\nWang (2012) and Bonini (2015) study changes in operating performance in the wake of the \\nprimary and the secondary buyout. Both Wang (2012) and Bonini (2015) report a slowdown in \\nvalue creation: Although a portfolio company’ s operating performance improves significantly \\nduring its first spell in a PE fund’ s portfolio, this improvement does not differ from that of simi -\\nlar control firms during its second spell. Some support thus exists for the notion of diminishing \\nreturns to PE value creation.\\nDegeorge, Martin, and Phalippou (2016) and Arcot et al. (2015) study conflicts of interest in the \\ncontext of secondary buyouts. Degeorge, Martin, and Phalippou (2016) report that secondary \\nbuyouts undertaken late in the buying fund’ s commitment period destroy value, consistent with \\nmisaligned incentives. After fees, such secondary buyouts have a PME of 0.88 and thus under -\\nperform the stock market. Secondary buyouts undertaken early in the buying fund’ s commit -\\nment period, however, perform in line with primary buyouts. Interestingly, it is when the selling \\nPE fund and the buying PE fund have complementary skills that secondary buyouts generate \\nthe highest PME. This dynamic suggests that although there may be diminishing returns to PE \\nvalue creation in general, additional value can be created when the buying PE fund can bring \\nnew skills to the table.\\nArcot et al. (2015) also study secondary market pricing through the lens of agency concerns. \\nThey construct an index of how much pressure either the buying or the selling PE fund is under \\nbased on how close the fund is to the end of the commitment period or the end of its term, its \\nremaining capital (or dry powder), and its reputation. Consistent with misaligned incentives, \\nArcot et al. (2015) report that pressured sellers sell at lower valuation multiples, while pressured \\nbuyers buy at higher valuation multiples.\\nGP-led secondaries provide liquidity to LPs in the original fund, which has become particu -\\nlarly important as exits through an IPO or a sale to a strategic or a financial buyer have slowed \\nmarkedly in recent years, in the wake of central banks’ concerted interest rate rises. Yet GP-led \\nsecondaries are controversial. When the PE firm acts as both buyer and seller in a transaction, \\nin whose interest will it price the deal?43 Moreover, if the transaction results in the portfolio \\ncompany’ s reported valuation increasing, the PE firm will benefit from an increase in the base \\non which it earns its management fee. Finally, in a single-asset continuation fund that holds \\nwhat is presumably an already successful company, the PE firm can expect a higher carried \\ninterest payout than if the future gains on the company were first used to make up for the losers \\nin the original fund’ s portfolio. Although there is no existing research into GP-led secondaries \\nin economics, Kastiel and Nini (Forthcoming) analyze these and other concerns from a legal \\nperspective.\\nA final exit-related innovation worth mentioning is the rise of NAV financing. Given the current \\nchallenging exit market, GPs have trouble generating distributions for their LPs through portfo -\\nlio company exits. Some GPs have turned to NAV financing, which involves borrowing against \\na PE fund’ s assets and then making distributions to their LPs (essentially, a leveraged dividend \\nrecap). Whether and how NAV financing might add value to LPs are important open questions.\\n43A new SEC rule effective November 2023 requires PE firms to obtain a fairness opinion in GP-led secondaries. \\nSee www .sec.gov/files/rules/final/2023/ia-6383.pdf .', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='b6abbcf5-75fd-4c9c-a9d6-ad8cee688935', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '27', 'file_name': '6636d92f-27a6-4e61-acbb-72756f6e3125_The Economics of Private Equity_ A Critical Review.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\\nCFA Institute Research Foundation  27ESG\\nOver the last decade, ESG has become a core due diligence criterion in private equity.

Private equity funds generate returns for their investors through a combination of \\nthe value they add to their portfolio companies and their ability to target companies whose \\nperformance is about to take off anyway.\\n• Whether private equity creates social value for the economy at large is an open question. \\nResearch suggests that there can be both winners and losers when private equity invests in \\na company. Netting off gains and losses involves tricky value judgments.\\n• Private equity is a demanding asset class in which more sophisticated investors can expect \\nto earn better returns than less sophisticated investors. There is scope for ample misalign -\\nment of interests between fund managers and investors.\\n• Private equity is an innovative asset class, creating new practices and solutions at a fast \\npace. Recent examples include subscription lines, GP-led secondaries, and NAV financing.\\nPrivate equity has received due attention from financial economists.

The authors argue that this cyclicality is driven by the pro-cyclical nature of PE \\ninvestment activity and the variation in capital market conditions over the PE fund life cycle. \\nThey also show that the cyclicality of PE fund performance can lead to significant biases \\nin performance measurement, particularly when using metrics that do not account for the \\ntiming and magnitude of cash flows, such as the internal rate of return (IRR).', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='a26f12c7-64a2-4ac6-9cbf-dda35c1b5727', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '52', 'file_name': '6636d92f-27a6-4e61-acbb-72756f6e3125_The Economics of Private Equity_ A Critical Review.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\\n52  CFA Institute Research FoundationRubinstein, M. 1976. “The Strong Case for the Generalized Logarithmic Utility Model as the \\nPremier Model of Financial Markets. ” Journal of Finance  31 (2):551–71. doi:10.2307 /2326626\\nThe author argues for the generalized logarithmic utility model as the most suitable model \\nfor understanding financial markets. This model is consistent with several important empiri -\\ncal observations, such as the positive relationship between risk and return, the existence of a \\nrisk-free rate, and the diversity of portfolio holdings among investors. The model implies that \\ninvestors will hold a combination of the risk-free asset and a well-diversified portfolio of risky \\nassets, with the proportion allocated to each determined by their level of risk aversion.

Using a dataset of 1,852 PE funds \\nraised between 1991 and 2006, the authors find that the performance of LPs has declined \\nover time, particularly for large, established LPs. This decline is primarily driven by the increas -\\ning competition for deals and the decreasing returns to scale in the PE industry. The study \\nalso reveals that LPs’ experience and access to top-performing PE firms, which were once \\nsources of competitive advantage, have become less important as the industry has matured.\\nShive, S.

The study investigates how \\ndifferences in governance mechanisms impact firms’ environmental behavior and their con -\\ntribution to pollution externalities. Using empirical analysis, the authors shed light on how \\ncorporate governance practices influence firms’ environmental performance and their role in \\nmitigating or exacerbating pollution externalities.\\nSørensen, M., and R. Jagannathan. 2015. “The Public Market Equivalent and Private Equity \\nPerformance. ” Financial Analysts Journal  71 (4):43–50. doi:10.2469/faj.v71.n4.4\\nThe article provides a theoretical justification for using the public market equivalent (PME) \\nmeasure to evaluate the performance of private equity (PE) funds. The authors show that the \\nPME is equivalent to assessing PE performance using the dynamic version of the CAPM devel -\\noped by Rubinstein (1976). Under this model, PE cash flows are valued by discounting them \\nwith realized market returns. This approach automatically adjusts for the systematic risk of the \\ninvestment without requiring explicit calculation of betas. The authors argue the PME is robust \\nto manipulation and changes in leverage. They conclude that when calculating the PME, the \\nmarket index used should approximate the return on the PE investor’ s overall wealth portfolio.\\nSørensen, M., N. Wang, and J.

The authors find that costs of illiquidity and GP compensation are \\nsubstantial. Leverage reduces these costs and may justify the high levels of debt used in PE \\ntransactions.

The article suggests that by using value investing strategies, \\nhomemade leverage, and hold-to-maturity accounting practices, investors can mimic the \\nreturn profile of PE investments. The author provides theoretical insights and empirical evi -\\ndence to support the effectiveness of this replication strategy, offering investors an alternative \\napproach to accessing the benefits typically associated with private equity investments.\\nStucke, R. 2011. “Updating History. ” Working paper, University of Oxford. doi:10.2139/\\nssrn.1967636\\nThe author analyzes the Thomson VentureXpert (TVE) database, which has been widely used to \\nbenchmark the performance of private equity and venture capital funds. The study finds severe \\nanomalies in the underlying data, resulting from funds that stopped being updated during their \\nactive lifetime. About 40% of funds have missing cash flows, mainly on the distribution side, \\nand carried-forward net asset values, leading to a significant downward bias in private equity \\nperformance. Consequently, the author argues that many empirical results established using the \\nTVE database may not be replicable with correct data. In particular, the claim that private equity \\nhas not outperformed public equity is unlikely to hold with the true fund performance data.\\nTommar, S. A., S. Darolles, and E.

Both investment strategy and geography are \\nimportant for fund performance, with buyout funds performing best in Europe, growth equity \\nfunds performing best in Asia Pacific, and venture capital creating modest returns across all \\nregions. There is also evidence of strong performance persistence and market segmenta -\\ntion for buyout and growth funds in Europe, as well as for globally diversified, US-sponsored \\nbuyout funds, but there is no such evidence in Asia Pacific.\\nWang, Y. 2012. “Secondary Buyouts: Why Buy and at What Price?” Journal of Corporate Finance  \\n18 (5):1306–25. doi:10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2012.09.002\\nThe author investigates three potential explanations for secondary buyouts: efficiency gains, \\nliquidity-based market timing, and collusion. The results are most consistent with liquidity-based \\nmarket timing. Firms are more likely to exit through secondary buyouts when the equity market \\nis “cold, ” the debt market condition is favorable, and the sellers face a high demand for liquidity. \\nSecondary buyouts are priced higher than first-time buyouts because of favorable debt market \\nconditions. Overall, the results suggest that secondary buyouts serve primarily to alleviate the \\nfinancial needs of private equity firms rather than to create value for target companies.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='1b7c2105-f4e7-4484-8786-7f2b6f812da2', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '54', 'file_name': '6636d92f-27a6-4e61-acbb-72756f6e3125_The Economics of Private Equity_ A Critical Review.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='Ameritech\\nAnonymous\\nRobert D.
