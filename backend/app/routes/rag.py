    'md': '# A BRIEF HISTORY OF PRIVATE EQUITY\n\nPrivate equity, in the sense of investments in assets not traded on a stock market, has been around for centuries. The PE industry as we know it today traces its roots to the mid-20th century. Some say that the first leveraged buyout took place in 1955, when McLean Industries, Inc. acquired two steamship companies. In the 1960s, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Victor Posner’s DWG Corporation popularized the practice of acquiring portfolios of companies much in the same way as PE firms do today.\n\nThe growth of the junk bond market in the 1970s and 1980s made possible highly leveraged buyouts of even very large targets such as RJR Nabisco, acquired by KKR in 1989 for a record-breaking $31.1 billion. Many of the 1980s buyouts were hostile in the sense that the acquisition proceeded against target management’s will.\n\nAs interest rates increased in the late 1980s and the economy headed into a recession, many of the highest-profile leveraged buyouts ran into trouble. By 1990, an era came to an end when Drexel Burnham Lambert agreed not to contest six federal felony charges, paid a record fine of $650 million, and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nDuring the 1990s, private equity recovered and institutionalized. Deal sizes increased while value-creation strategies became less hostile and more focused on bringing about operational efficiencies. Fund sizes increased commensurately, and mega-funds became more common.\n\nThe bursting of the technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) bubble in the early 2000s left in its wake many high-profile casualties—notably two leading private equity firms, Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst and Forstmann, Little & Company. Between 2000 and 2003, deal sizes and leverage ratios fell again, and some early investors in private equity (such as Chase Capital Partners) sold off their investments in PE funds.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2007, the PE market first recovered (as interest rates fell) and then boomed. Deal sizes grew to the point where “club deals,” the practice of syndicating the acquisition of a large target among a group of PE funds, became common. Marking the peak, a consortium led by KKR and TPG acquired Texan utility TXU in October 2007 for $44.37 billion, much of it funded by debt. (TXU filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2014.)\n\nThe 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis, and the accompanying Great Recession of 2008-2009, led to a credit crunch—especially in the high-yield debt markets that PE firms depend on to finance their deals. It took seven years for PE fundraising to again surpass the level reached in 2007.\n\nRecord-low interest rates have marked the near-decade since then, contributing to a boom in fundraising and dealmaking. Then, as central banks around the world began raising interest rates in early 2022 in an attempt to bring down inflation, dealmaking, portfolio company exits, and fundraising all slowed sharply.',

Moreover, sudden changes in industry practices—such as the current waning popularity of subscription lines because interest rates have increased from record lows—can shift the J-curve in unexpected ways and thereby put strain on LPs’ liquidity management.\n\nLPs cannot easily sell their fund interests. The LPA almost always gives the GP the right to veto the transfer of an LP’s fund interest. This is not to say that no such transfers take place—indeed, funds specializing in acquiring “secondary” stakes in PE funds raised a cumulative $227 billion during 2018–2022, according to Secondaries Investor—but there is no liquid marketplace in fund interests. Instead, specialized investment banking teams broker secondary sales by approaching potential buyers and inviting them to submit indicative bids, with the seller then negotiating with shortlisted bidders. According to Lerner and Schoar (2004), who study the United States, one reason why PE firms have resisted the emergence of a marketplace for fund interests may be tax law: US limited partnerships would lose their flow-through (untaxed) status under IRC Section 7704 if they were considered “publicly traded.”'}],

    'md': '# THE PERFORMANCE OF PRIVATE EQUITY\n\nHow does private equity perform as an asset class? This seemingly straightforward question proves difficult to answer, for four principal reasons.\n\n- **Private equity is an opaque asset class:** Although a PE fund has a duty to report its performance to its LPs (and, in the United States since 2012, to the SEC), it has no obligation to disclose its performance to the public. LPAs often explicitly bar LPs from sharing performance data they receive from a PE fund (and the SEC does not make individual fund disclosures public). Data availability thus constrains performance measurement.\n  \n- **Private equity largely invests in private assets:** Not being traded in financial markets, private assets cannot be marked to market easily, and estimating their value before exit is difficult.\n\n- **Private equity invests in illiquid assets:** Illiquidity exposes a PE fund to the risk that there may be insufficient demand at an acceptable valuation when a portfolio company is ready to be exited.\n\n- **Private equity has long investment horizons:** As the J-curve illustrates, PE funds are usually cash flow negative for many years before they begin returning capital, and they typically generate capital gains only toward the end of their lives.\n\n## Industry Practices\n\nThe PE industry usually reports three key performance indicators (KPIs) to LPs: IRR, TVPI, and DPI.\n\n- **IRR** stands for internal rate of return and is well known from standard MBA textbooks. It measures the fund’s annualized rate of return, considering the timing and magnitude of the fund’s cash flows (i.e., its drawdowns and net-of-fees distributions). As such, an IRR can be computed only once a fund has been wound down at the end of its life, yet it is standard industry practice to report IRRs throughout a fund’s life. To this end, a fund treats the estimated value of its unrealized portfolio holdings as a future terminal cash flow.\n\n- Because portfolio holdings are private and illiquid, estimating their value accurately can be challenging. Interim IRRs are thus, at minimum, noisy estimates of future performance. As I will discuss later, practitioners often worry that interim IRRs are manipulated, especially ahead of a PE firm’s next fundraise. Even “final” IRRs may be misleading: LPs often worry that a GP may manipulate the fund’s lifetime IRR—for example, by using subscription lines or by choosing the timing and size of the fund’s investments in self-serving ways.\n\n- **TVPI** stands for total value to paid-in capital. It equals the total value of the net-of-fees distributions received by a fund’s LPs to date plus the estimated value of unrealized portfolio holdings, divided by LPs’ capital contributions. A TVPI greater than 1 indicates that the fund has',

Kaplan and Schoar (2005) were the first to study persistence, finding that in the 1980s and 1990s, PE firms that outperformed their peers in one fund were likely to continue outperforming their peers in subsequent funds. \n\nPersistence is seen as indicative of GP skill. Using different data and empirical approaches, Robinson and Sensoy (2016), Korteweg and Sorensen (2017), and Gupta and van Nieuwerburgh (2021) likewise find evidence of persistence, although Harris, Jenkinson, Kaplan, and Stucke (2023) and Braun, Jenkinson, and Stoff (2017) show that persistence has weakened over time at the fund and the deal level, respectively. The return spread can be large: Korteweg and Sorensen (2017) estimate that top-quartile funds persistently outperform bottom-quartile funds by 7–8 percentage points a year. Return persistence in private equity contrasts sharply with that of mutual funds, for which past performance is viewed as a poor predictor of future performance.\n\nWhether LPs can exploit persistence in practice is open to question: Many studies estimate persistence from the realized returns funds will earn over their approximately 10-year lifetimes, yet PE firms raise new funds every 3–5 years, well before the final returns on their current funds are realized and publicly known. When deciding to invest in a new fund, LPs therefore have to make do with publicly available data on the current fund’s interim KPIs (such as net-of-fee IRR to date, TVPI, and DPI). Interim performance is a much noisier predictor of the next fund’s performance than the current fund’s lifetime return once realized in the future. Based on this insight, Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Vissing-Jørgensen (2014) propose a model in which LPs that invest in a PE firm’s current fund have an information advantage over other potential investors in the next fund, in the form of access to “soft” information about the GP’s ability to persistently generate high returns. This information advantage gives current LPs bargaining power vis-à-vis the GP. The model can explain the empirical regularity that PE firms tend not to raise their fees in line with their performance and instead “price” their funds to have excess demand from LPs. Investors in earlier funds then earn abnormal returns in later funds as they can “hold up” the GP by threatening not to invest in the next fund, which other market participants with access only to public information would interpret as a negative signal in the familiar adverse-selection sense. \n\n> **Note:** Part of the observed return persistence is mechanical because consecutive funds are raised only a few years apart and are subject to similar macroeconomic conditions.

In summary, times of abundant LP capital and times of abundant, cheap debt both appear to be associated with lower returns in PE.\n\nRobinson and Sensoy (2016) take issue with these findings, reporting that vintage-year inflows cease to predict future performance when switching from absolute performance metrics such as IRR to relative performance metrics such as PME (notwithstanding the fact that both Axelson et al. [2013] and Harris, Jenkinson, and Kaplan [2014] find predictability using PME)."}],

    'md': "# The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\n\nAs the example of Bloom, Sadun, and van Reenen's (2015) study shows, establishing a PE treatment effect at minimum requires observing portfolio companies before, during, and (ideally) after PE ownership (and even then, selection effects are difficult to rule out, as I will argue). Methodologically, the current state of the art in the literature is to compare the evolution of PE portfolio companies during the PE ownership period to that of “control” firms with similar characteristics that did not receive PE investment. Any remaining differences in performance between the two groups are then attributed to PE ownership. The implicit assumption is that absent PE ownership, portfolio companies would have performed similarly to the control companies on average. The characteristics typically controlled for in this “control firm” approach include, at minimum, size, industry, and year.\n\nWhen measured this way, there is ample evidence that portfolio companies undergo significant operational changes during the PE ownership period. Using proprietary data on 395 portfolio companies of 48 European PE funds, Acharya, Gottschalg, Hahn, and Kehoe (2013) report that portfolio companies grow sales and profitability faster than the median stock market listed firm in the same industry during the ownership period. Using confidential data from corporate income tax returns, Cohn, Hotchkiss, and Towery (2022) report similar evidence for the United States, showing that portfolio companies experience rapid growth in sales and moderate growth in profitability compared with control firms matched on industry and prior profitability and leverage. Using French tax data, Boucly, Sraer, and Thesmar (2011) find that similar patterns hold in France.\n\nWhat might underlie these headline increases in profitability? In an early study, Lichtenberg and Siegel (1990) use data from the US Census Bureau to show that manufacturing plants owned by PE portfolio companies through the 1980s increased their total factor productivity (i.e., their output per unit of total input) by significantly more than the industry average as white-collar employment and wages fell. Using more recent US Census Bureau data, Davis, Haltiwanger, Handley, Jarmin, Lerner, and Miranda (2014) confirm that portfolio companies experience an increase in productivity compared with control firms matched on industry, size, age, and prior growth. Their establishment-level data allow them to show that productivity grows as portfolio companies exit their less productive units, expand their more productive units, and create new, more productive establishments. This reshuffling of production assets entails high gross labor turnover as employees are hired and fired, although the net job loss is found to be relatively small.\n\nUsing similar data for a longer period, Davis, Haltiwanger, Handley, Lipsius, Lerner, and Miranda (2021) show that employment declines after buyouts of listed companies and expands after buyouts of unlisted companies. Gornall, Gredil, Howell, Liu, and Sockin (Forthcoming) find that although wages are unchanged on average, job satisfaction ratings drop at portfolio companies.",

A quartet of recent papers study PE investment in health care, without reaching a consensus.\n\n## Findings on PE Investment in Health Care\n\n- **Gao, Sevilir, and Kim (2021)**: Hospitals acquired by PE funds improve their operational efficiency without compromising health care quality at patients’ expense.\n- **Liu (2021)**: PE investment leads to higher health care costs—first because PE-owned hospitals negotiate price increases with private insurers that average 69%, and second because other local hospitals piggyback on these increases in reimbursement rates by negotiating higher reimbursement rates of their own, averaging 8%. Operational efficiency improves as well, but it does so only marginally and not enough to offset the price increases.\n\n## Causality and Mortality Rates\n\n- **Gupta, Howell, Yannelis, and Gupta (2024)**: Report higher mortality rates among Medicare patients in nursing homes owned by PE funds than at other nursing homes. The authors do not consider whether nursing home acquisitions create value for investors, and it is unclear whether PE funds created value at the expenses of patients or whether these were deals that destroyed value for investors and so were mistakes that will not be repeated.\n- **Gandhi, Song, and Upadhrashta (2023)**: Provide nuance to Gupta et al.'s (2024) findings, showing that patients are harmed only when local competitive pressures are low: In competitive local markets, care homes owned by PE firms instead offer greater quality of care.\n\n## Higher Education and PE Investment\n\n- **Eaton, Howell, and Yannelis (2020)**: Report that at higher education institutions acquired by PE funds, tuition rates and student debt levels rise while graduation rates, loan repayment rates, and future earnings fall in comparison to other observably similar for-profit schools. In other words, in the average higher-education deal in Eaton, Howell, and Yannelis’s (2020) sample, PE funds created value for their LPs at the expense of students and the local labor market.\n- **Ewens, Gupta, and Howell (2022)**: Paint a similarly negative picture of negative externalities when local newspapers are acquired by PE funds: Voter turnout falls in subsequent local elections.\n\n## Environmental Performance of PE Portfolio Companies\n\n- **Shive and Forster (2020)**: Focus on greenhouse gas emissions, reporting that PE portfolio companies pollute no more than stock market listed firms matched on industry, time, location, and other firm characteristics (although both groups pollute more than similar privately held firms).\n- **Bellon (2022)**: Focuses on environmental pollution in the oil and gas fracking industry, reporting.\n\nCFA Institute Research Foundation • 19",

    'md': '# The Economics of Private Equity: A Critical Review\n\nRobinson and Sensoy (2013) investigate LPs’ recurrent concern that GPs earn excessive management fees but find no evidence that high-fee funds underperform low-fee funds after fees. The same appears to be true for the carried interest, which also does not predict after-fee returns. The finer details of GPs’ compensation formulas, however, appear to distort GP incentives. Robinson and Sensoy (2013) also find that PE funds time their portfolio exits in a self-serving manner. They tend to accelerate portfolio company sales during the “catch-up” period of their compensation waterfall (which has the effect of increasing their carried-interest payoff). In addition, PE funds tend to delay the sale (or write-off) of underperforming portfolio companies once the basis for the management fee switches from committed capital to net invested capital (which has the effect of increasing the amount of management fees that PE funds charge).\n\nA different type of conflict of interest can arise in connection with follow-on fundraising. To stay in business long term, a GP has to raise follow-on funds; the performance of the GP’s current fund affects the GP’s ability to raise the next fund (Chung, Sensoy, Stern, and Weisbach 2012; Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Vissing-Jørgensen 2014; Barber and Yasuda 2017). The problem for potential LPs is that GPs, in order to be able to invest beyond their current fund’s commitment period, need to raise their next fund before the current fund has realized all its investments. The current fund’s reported performance thus consists of (objective) cash flows from realized investments and (more or less subjective) accounting valuations of unrealized portfolio companies. This situation raises the concern that GPs may game reported valuations.\n\nThe academic evidence on this type of gaming is mixed. Using fund-level data, Barber and Yasuda (2017) report that PE firms time their fundraising to coincide with a peak in their current fund’s reported performance—and not just because they naturally tend to fundraise in the wake of successful exits.

Beginning in the mid-2000s, a third type of exit emerged: sponsor-to-sponsor deals (also called secondary buyouts), in which a PE firm’s PE fund sells its portfolio company to another PE firm’s PE fund. Secondary buyouts now account for more than half of PE exits. More recently, a fourth type of exit has become popular: GP-led secondaries, in which a PE firm’s PE fund sells its portfolio company to another fund controlled by the same PE firm (essentially, the PE firm sells the portfolio company to itself). The acquiring fund is typically a newly formed “continuation vehicle” that will often own no other assets (i.e., it is a single-asset fund). The LPs in the selling fund are usually invited to invest in the continuation vehicle, although they may be required to simultaneously commit capital to the GP’s next fund (a so-called “stapled” transaction).

The academic literature to date has focused on secondary buyouts. LPs may be concerned about secondary buyouts for three reasons. First, if there are diminishing returns to PE value creation, a secondary buyer may struggle to add much value to a portfolio company, resulting in lower returns. Second, buying funds may buy because they have capital left to burn toward the end of their life, rather than because the deal is likely to be good for their LPs. This concern arises because of the one-way-bet nature of GP compensation: It may be tempting (from the viewpoint of a GP that does not value its reputation too highly) to draw down the last few dollars of capital. If the deal pays off, the GP will earn carry; if the deal goes south, the GP will have lost “OPM” (other people’s money).

Both Wang (2012) and Bonini (2015) report a slowdown in value creation: Although a portfolio company’s operating performance improves significantly during its first spell in a PE fund’s portfolio, this improvement does not differ from that of similar control firms during its second spell. Some support thus exists for the notion of diminishing returns to PE value creation.\n\nDegorge, Martin, and Phalippou (2016) and Arcot et al. (2015) study conflicts of interest in the context of secondary buyouts. Degorge, Martin, and Phalippou (2016) report that secondary buyouts undertaken late in the buying fund’s commitment period destroy value, consistent with misaligned incentives. After fees, such secondary buyouts have a PME of 0.88 and thus underperform the stock market. Secondary buyouts undertaken early in the buying fund’s commitment period, however, perform in line with primary buyouts. Interestingly, it is when the selling PE fund and the buying PE fund have complementary skills that secondary buyouts generate the highest PME. This dynamic suggests that although there may be diminishing returns to PE value creation in general, additional value can be created when the buying PE fund can bring new skills to the table.\n\nArcot et al. (2015) also study secondary market pricing through the lens of agency concerns.

Analyzing 395 deals by 37 PE houses in Western Europe from 1991 to 2007, the study finds that a significant portion of deal IRRs stems from abnormal performance, indicating enterprise-level value creation beyond that of sector peers.

Through novel data, the study explores how SLCs affect capital deployment from limited partners (LPs), fund performance, and whether their uses align with cash flow management or stem from agency conflicts.

The analysis reveals a shift from domestic listed corporations holding 70% of electricity generation to 54%, with private equity (PE), institutional investors, and foreign corporations increasing their shares, particularly in renewable and fossil fuel power plants. The study identifies three main mechanisms driving these changes: creation of new power plants, transactions of existing plants, and decommissioning of outdated facilities. New entrants, particularly PE and foreign corporations, have played a crucial role in adopting new technologies and improving the efficiency of electricity generation, suggesting that competitive pressures and capital availability, rather than traditional incumbency advantages, are driving the industry’s evolution towards sustainability and innovation.\n\n## Ang, A., B.

Contrary to expectations, the analysis finds no significant productivity improvements in plants post-transition to private ownership compared with their peers. Instead, going-private transactions result in reduced capital stock and employment, while operational efficiency remains unchanged. The results challenge the notion that private ownership inherently leads to operational improvements, indicating that gains from going-private transactions may stem from better identification of productive plants and strategic exits rather than enhanced operational efficiency within plants.\n\n### Biesinger, M., C.

They show that PE firms create value for investors by selecting companies that are about to outperform and by helping portfolio companies improve production. They find no evidence that financial engineering affects investor returns.\n\n### Block, J., Y. S. Jang, S. N. Kaplan, and A.

Through a survey of 191 US and European PD investors, the study inspects PD funds' operational strategies, particularly direct lending, and compares them with banks, PE funds, and CLOs. The findings highlight PD funds' preference for stable cash flows, their perceived role in providing financing where banks may not, and their use of both negative and financial covenants for monitoring, akin to a hybrid of bank loans and covenant-lite leveraged loans.\n\n### Bloom, N., R.

Using a survey of more than 15,000 firms across 34 countries, the authors find that PE-owned firms have superior management practices, particularly compared with family-owned and managed firms. The PE advantage is especially strong in monitoring and operational practices associated with modern management technologies. Additionally, PE-owned firms show greater delegation of authority to plant managers in areas such as sales, marketing, and new product introductions. The authors cannot definitively determine, however, whether the superior management of PE-owned firms results from PE firms selecting already well-managed targets or improving the management of acquired firms over time.",

The article analyzes the operating performance of 163 companies across two buyout rounds. Although first-round buyouts lead to significant efficiency gains, SBOs do not show incremental operating performance improvements.

It finds that LBO targets in France, particularly in private-to-private transactions, exhibit significant post-buyout growth in employment, sales, and capital employed compared with control firms. This growth is accompanied by an increase in capital expenditures and debt issuance, suggesting that private equity funds help previously credit-constrained firms capitalize on unexploited growth opportunities.

The research highlights that skilled LPs consistently outperform others, emphasizing that the ability to select high-quality general partners (GPs) is a critical determinant of success in PE investing.\n\nChung, J.

The article highlights the significance of indirect, market-based pay for performance stemming from the relationship between a fund’s current performance and its ability to raise future capital. This market-based pay for performance, when added to direct compensation from carried interest, implies GPs’ income is more closely tied to their funds’ success than previously believed, highlighting the complexity of incentive structures in PE and the critical role of skill and performance in securing future capital.\n\nCohn, J.

Using US corporate tax return data, the authors explore profitability improvements, financial engineering, and easing financial constraints as potential value sources. PE targets include firms at both high and low profitability extremes, suggesting varied strategies for value creation. Post-buyout, there is moderate profitability improvement and significant sales growth, indicating that unlocking growth potential is crucial. Despite an increase in debt-to-assets ratio, financial engineering appears secondary to facilitating growth.\n\nCohn, J., L. Mills, and E.

They find no significant improvements in operating performance post-LBO. There is evidence of sustained high leverage levels post-LBO without significant debt reduction, indicating that LBOs might not aim to discipline management through debt repayment as traditionally thought.

The authors further report that it is when the selling private equity (PE) fund and the buying PE fund have complementary skills that secondary buyouts generate the highest performance.\n\n2. **Driessen, J., T.-C.

By extending the internal rate of return calculation with a dynamic discount rate, the method addresses the challenge of limited data availability and the absence of traded asset prices. Simulations validate the approach’s accuracy in estimating key parameters, while empirical application to private equity funds provides information on market betas, costs of capital, and abnormal returns.\n\n3. **Dueski, T., C. Rastogi, and T. Yao. 2023.** “ESG Incidents and Fundraising in Private Equity.” Working paper, HEC Paris. doi:10.2139/ssrn.4641071  \n   The paper highlights the absence of systematic academic evidence on the impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors on PE, emphasizing the differences between public and private markets regarding liquidity, regulatory scrutiny, and investor influence. The paper fills this gap by examining how ESG considerations affect PE firms’ capital raising ability. Using data on ESG-related incidents and PE investment data, the study investigates the outcomes of such incidents on PE firms’ fundraising success and fund size.\n\n4. **Dyck, A., and L. Pomorski. 2016.** “Investor Scale and Performance in Private Equity Investments.” *Review of Finance* 20 (3):1081-106. doi:10.1093/rof/rfv030  \n   The study explores the impact of investor scale in private equity (PE) on performance, moving beyond traditional analyses focusing solely on limited partner (LP) investments. Using data from DB pension plans, it investigates how varying levels of PE investments affect returns. The study reveals that larger investors tend to outperform smaller ones, with a one-standard-deviation increase in PE holdings associated with 4% greater returns. Larger investors achieve cost savings by limiting intermediation services.\n\n5. **Eaton, C., S. T. Howell, and C.

Using data from 88 deals involving private equity firms acquiring independent schools, it examines how these transactions affect various metrics of firm value and student outcomes.

Through employee reviews, the study examines how PE buyouts affect compensation satisfaction, work-life balance, and firm culture. Findings suggest that PE ownership is associated with declines in satisfaction with compensation. However, high-performing PE deals correlate with happier employees.\n\n## Gredil, O. 2022. “Do Private Equity Managers Have Superior Information on Public Markets?” Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis 57 (1):321–58. doi:10.1017/S0022109021000107\n\nThe study investigates the market-timing abilities of private equity (PE) general partners (GPs) and the implications for fund investors. It highlights the influence of public capital markets on PE fund outcomes and explores how GPs leverage their informational advantage to time entry and exit decisions. The paper demonstrates that GPs’ market-timing decisions create economic value for fund investors.\n\n## Gredil, O., M. Sørensen, and W. Waller. 2019. “Evaluating Private Equity Performance Using Stochastic Discount Factors.” Working paper, Tulane University. doi:10.2139/ssrn.3506847\n\nThe paper examines the performance evaluation of private equity (PE) funds in the context of institutional investors' specific investment objectives. It contrasts traditional performance metrics with consumption-based asset pricing models (CBAPMs) to assess PE fund performance relative to non-tradable discount factors. The study investigates the correlation between model-implied stochastic discount factors (SDFs) and real growth in gifts to university endowments and contributions to public pension plans. The findings suggest that CBAPMs provide valuable insights into the performance of PE funds, particularly in capturing long-run risks and minimizing variation in net present values (NPVs) across vintage years. Methodologically, the paper addresses biases in NPV-based performance measures and proposes corrections to enhance the accuracy of PE fund evaluations.\n\n## Guo, S., E. S. Hotchkiss, and W.

It finds that LBO firms generally experience significant increases in total value post-buyout, resulting in substantial returns to invested capital. Although gains in operating performance are smaller compared with those documented in the 1980s, improvements in cash flows, changes in industry valuations, and realized tax benefits from increased leverage contribute significantly to returns.",

Through case studies and empirical analysis, the study demonstrates how addressing ESG issues can lead to improved operational efficiency, enhanced brand reputation, and reduced regulatory and litigation risks for PE-backed companies. The findings suggest that incorporating ESG factors into investment decisions can generate both financial and non-financial benefits for investors and portfolio companies.\n\nIvashina, V., and A.

Analyzing syndicated loan data, the study finds that stronger bank relationships and potential for cross-selling lead to lower loan spreads and more favorable debt terms. These findings underscore the importance of LBO firms as financial intermediaries in facilitating LBO transactions and accessing favorable credit markets.\n\nJegadeesh, N., R. Kräussl, and J.

Managers have incentives for organizational growth beyond optimal levels, driven by power and compensation motives. The study proposes a theory highlighting the benefits of debt in reducing agency costs related to free cash flow, emphasizing debt's role in motivating efficiency and curtailing wasteful spending by managers. Evidence from financial restructuring, leveraged buyouts, and takeovers in industries like oil supports the theory.\n\n## Jensen, M.

Traditional public corporations face challenges such as bureaucracy, lack of flexibility, and short-term shareholder focus.

The findings suggest that MBOs often lead to improvements in operating performance, with increases in productivity and profitability observed post-transaction.

The authors highlight concerns around valuation practices, fees charged, and transparency, and they recommend regulatory changes and improved disclosures to mitigate these potential conflicts of interest.\n\nKirti, D., and N. Sarin. 2024. “What Private Equity Does Differently: Evidence from Life Insurance.” *Review of Financial Studies* 37 (1):201–30. doi:10.1093/rfs/hhad055  \nThis study examines how private equity (PE) firms operate and create value by analyzing their ownership of US life insurance companies from 2004–2014. The authors find that under PE ownership, life insurers reallocate their investment portfolios toward higher-risk, higher-yield assets like structured products and alternative investments. They also increase the rate of policy lapses and surrenders, suggesting PE firms prioritize fee income over long-term policy obligations. Additionally, PE-owned insurers shift toward more capital-intensive products with higher upfront costs. Overall, the evidence suggests PE firms pursue an “institutional capital management” strategy that differs from the strategies of traditional insurers.\n\nKorteweg, A. 2019. “Risk Adjustment in Private Equity Returns.” *Annual Review of Financial Economics* 11:131–52. doi:10.1146/annurev-financial-110118-123057  \nThe study examines methods for risk-adjusting the returns reported by private equity (PE) funds to make more appropriate comparisons to public market investments. Challenges in risk-adjusting PE returns include stale pricing of portfolio companies, the use of fund-level borrowing, and the interim recognition of fund fees and carried interest. The author evaluates different risk adjustment models like the public market equivalent and distributional methodologies. There is evidence that private equity returns are not merely compensation for risk.'}],

The authors find that VC fund returns remain high even after correcting for the excessive smoothing of returns and adjusting for risk exposures.

The authors develop a new methodology that separates fund performance into a skill component that persists across funds raised by the same manager and a luck/deal component that is uncorrelated across funds. They find that both skill and luck play highly significant roles. There is a skill premium, however, that is substantial in economic terms and has persisted over time.

PE-owned hospitals charge significantly higher prices compared with non-PE-owned hospitals. These price increases are primarily driven by PE-owned hospitals’ increased bargaining power and willingness to engage in tougher negotiations with insurers. The higher prices lead to a net reduction in patient welfare, because the price increases outweigh any potential quality improvements associated with PE ownership.\n\n## Ljungqvist, A., and M. Richardson. 2003. “The Cash Flow, Return, and Risk Characteristics of Private Equity.”\n- NBER Working Paper 9454. doi:10.3386/w9454\n- The authors analyze the cash flow, return, and risk characteristics of private equity (PE) funds. Theirs is the first study that had access to detailed cash flow data for each fund, rather than aggregate or self-reported returns. These data allow the authors to map out the J-curve using real data. The authors show that it takes several years for capital to be invested and more than 10 years for capital to be returned to generate excess returns. They then relate the rates of drawdowns and distributions to changes in investment opportunities and competition among PE funds. The authors estimate that PE funds in their sample generated annual excess returns of 5% to 8% relative to the public equity market, earning a risk-adjusted public market equivalent (PME) of 1.24. The authors conjecture that this level of excess returns represents compensation for holding an illiquid investment.\n\n## Ljungqvist, A., M. Richardson, and D. Wolfenzon. 2020. “The Investment Behavior of Buyout Funds: Theory and Evidence.”\n- Financial Management 49 (1):3–32. doi:10.1111/fima.12264\n- The authors theoretically model and empirically test the determinants of private equity (PE) funds’ investment decisions, which they link to changes in the demand for PE, conditions in the credit market, and PE fund managers’ ability to influence perceptions of their talent. In their empirical tests, the authors use a dataset of 207 US PE funds that invested in 1,957 portfolio companies over a 30-year period. For established funds, but not for first-time funds, the authors find that funds accelerate their investment rate and generate higher returns for investors when investment opportunities improve, competition for deal flow eases, and credit market conditions loosen. Less established funds invest in riskier portfolio companies in an effort to create a track record. PE funds become more conservative in their investment behavior following periods of good performance.\n\n## Long, A., and C.

This model is consistent with several important empirical observations, such as the positive relationship between risk and return, the existence of a risk-free rate, and the diversity of portfolio holdings among investors. The model implies that investors will hold a combination of the risk-free asset and a well-diversified portfolio of risky assets, with the proportion allocated to each determined by their level of risk aversion. The study has had a significant impact on the development of financial economics.\n\n## Sensoy, B. A., Y. Wang, and M. S.

Using a dataset of 1,852 PE funds raised between 1991 and 2006, the authors find that the performance of LPs has declined over time, particularly for large, established LPs. This decline is primarily driven by increasing competition for deals and the decreasing returns to scale in the PE industry. The study also reveals that LPs' experience and access to top-performing PE firms, which were once sources of competitive advantage, have become less important as the industry has matured.\n\n## Shive, S.

The study investigates how differences in governance mechanisms impact firms’ environmental behavior and their contribution to pollution externalities. Using empirical analysis, the authors shed light on how corporate governance practices influence firms’ environmental performance and their role in mitigating or exacerbating pollution externalities.\n\n## Sørensen, M., and R.

The authors show that the PME is equivalent to assessing PE performance using the dynamic version of the CAPM developed by Rubinstein (1976). Under this model, PE cash flows are valued by discounting them with realized market returns. This approach automatically adjusts for the systematic risk of the investment without requiring explicit calculation of betas. The authors argue the PME is robust to manipulation and changes in leverage. They conclude that when calculating the PME, the market index used should approximate the return on the PE investor’s overall wealth portfolio.\n\n## Sørensen, M., N. Wang, and J.

The article suggests that by using value investing strategies, homemade leverage, and hold-to-maturity accounting practices, investors can mimic the return profile of PE investments. The author provides theoretical insights and empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of this replication strategy, offering investors an alternative approach to accessing the benefits typically associated with private equity investments.\n\n## Stucke, R. 2011. \n### “Updating History.” \n**Working paper**, University of Oxford. doi:10.2139/ ssrn.197636  \nThe author analyzes the Thomson VentureXpert (TVE) database, which has been widely used to benchmark the performance of private equity and venture capital funds. The study finds severe anomalies in the underlying data, resulting from funds that stopped being updated during their active lifetime. About 40% of funds have missing cash flows, mainly on the distribution side, and carried-forward net asset values, leading to a significant downward bias in private equity performance. Consequently, the author argues that many empirical results established using the TVE database may not be replicable with correct data. In particular, the claim that private equity has not outperformed public equity is unlikely to hold with the true fund performance data.\n\n## Tommar, S. A., S. Darolles, and E. Jurczenko. 2024. \n### “Private Equity Performance around the World.” \n**Financial Analysts Journal** 80 (2):99-121. doi:10.1080/0015198X.2023. 2292545  \nThe authors examine the performance and persistence of private equity funds in international markets outside of North America. Both investment strategy and geography are important for fund performance, with buyout funds performing best in Europe, growth equity funds performing best in Asia Pacific, and venture capital creating modest returns across all regions. There is also evidence of strong performance persistence and market segmentation for buyout and growth funds in Europe, as well as for globally diversified, US-sponsored buyout funds, but there is no such evidence in Asia Pacific.\n\n## Wang, Y. 2012. \n### “Secondary Buyouts: Why Buy and at What Price?” \n**Journal of Corporate Finance** 18 (5):1306-25. doi:10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2012.09.002  \nThe author investigates three potential explanations for secondary buyouts: efficiency gains, liquidity-based market timing, and collusion. The results are most consistent with liquidity-based market timing. Firms are more likely to exit through secondary buyouts when the equity market is “cold,” the debt market condition is favorable, and the sellers face a high demand for liquidity. Secondary buyouts are priced higher than first-time buyouts because of favorable debt market conditions. Overall, the results suggest that secondary buyouts serve primarily to alleviate the financial needs of private equity firms rather than to create value for target companies.',

About 40% of funds have missing cash flows, mainly on the distribution side, and carried-forward net asset values, leading to a significant downward bias in private equity performance. Consequently, the author argues that many empirical results established using the TVE database may not be replicable with correct data. In particular, the claim that private equity has not outperformed public equity is unlikely to hold with the true fund performance data.'},

The results are most consistent with liquidity-based market timing. Firms are more likely to exit through secondary buyouts when the equity market is “cold,” the debt market condition is favorable, and the sellers face a high demand for liquidity. Secondary buyouts are priced higher than first-time buyouts because of favorable debt market conditions. Overall, the results suggest that secondary buyouts serve primarily to alleviate the financial needs of private equity firms rather than to create value for target companies.',
